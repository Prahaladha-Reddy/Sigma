# **Autonomous Vehicles: A Data-Driven Forecast on Deployment and Impact**

**Prepared by: Senior Data & Strategy Consulting**

# **1. The Premise: Separating Signal from Hype**

Optimistic forecasts predict imminent, widespread adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), often drawing parallels to consumer electronics. This analysis challenges that premise.

Motor vehicles are durable, highly-regulated goods where system failure is catastrophic. Historical data on automotive technology adoption suggests a far more gradual, multi-decade transition. Our objective is to provide a realistic, evidence-based forecast for AV deployment and its strategic implications for transport planning.

---

# **2. Establishing a Framework: The Levels of Automation**

To analyze AVs, we must use the standard SAE J3016 classification. The critical distinction is between Level 2/3 (Driver Assistance) and Level 4/5 (True Autonomy).

- **Level 2 (Partial):** Human driver must remain engaged. *(e.g., Tesla Autopilot, GM Super Cruise)*
- **Level 4 (High):** Vehicle is fully autonomous within a defined operational domain (ODD), like a geofenced city. * (e.g., Waymo robotaxis)*
- **Level 5 (Full):** Vehicle is autonomous under all conditions a human can handle. *This remains a distant technological goal.*

This analysis focuses on the deployment and impact of Level 4/5 vehicles.

# **3. The Central Tension: A Balanced View of Benefits and Costs**

The potential benefits of AVs are significant, but they are matched by substantial new costs and risks, both for the user (internal) and society (external).

| | Benefits | Costs/Problems |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Internal** | Reduced driver stress; Mobility for non-drivers; Lower taxi/commercial driver costs. | Increased vehicle costs; New risks from system failures; Reduced privacy and security. |
| **External** | Potential for increased safety; Increased road capacity; Reduced parking demand. | Increased infrastructure costs; New risks to non-auto travelers; **Increased VMT leading to more congestion & sprawl.** |

**Key Insight:** The data reveals that external costs, particularly the risk of increased Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), can negate many of the projected societal benefits if not managed by policy.

# **4. The Economic Barrier: Per-Mile Cost Analysis**

Contrary to the assumption of universal cost savings, the economic reality is more complex. Shared AVs are not a uniformly cheaper alternative to private vehicle ownership.

**Caption:** This chart reveals that while Shared AVs are cheaper than human-driven taxis, their average cost per mile can exceed that of private vehicles and public transit. This economic friction is a primary inhibitor to rapid, widespread adoption.

---

# **5. The Decisive Variable: Private vs. Shared Operating Models**

The societal impact of AVs is not monolithic; it is determined by the dominant ownership model. A private ownership model yields fundamentally different outcomes than a shared model.

| | Private Human-driven | **Private Autonomous** | Shared Autonomous | **Shared Autonomous Rides** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Financial Costs** | Low fixed | **High fixed** | Minimal fixed | **Minimum fixed** |
| **External Costs** | Moderate-High | **High (Increased VMT)** | Moderate | **Lowest (Reduced VMT)** |
| **Social Equity**| Inequitable | **Least equitable** | Mixed | **Most equitable** |

**Key Insight:** The data indicates a direct trade-off. Private AVs offer maximum convenience at the highest societal cost (congestion, inequity), while shared AVs with ridesharing offer the most societal benefits.

# **6. The Climax: A Realistic Deployment S-Curve**

Historical data on automotive technology adoption—from automatic transmissions to airbags—provides the most robust model for forecasting AV deployment. The data points to a slow, phased, S-curve adoption cycle, not a rapid revolution.

**Caption:** This projection, grounded in historical precedent, shows that 50% fleet penetration will not be reached until approximately 2060. Significant societal benefits like congestion reduction will only materialize in the later stages of this multi-decade transition.

---

# **7. The Evidence: Historical Adoption Precedent**

The S-curve model is not theoretical; it is based on the empirical reality of past vehicle technology rollouts. Major innovations consistently require decades to achieve market saturation.

| Technology | Deployment Cycle | Typical Cost Premium | Market Saturation Share |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Automatic transmissions | 50 years (1940s-90s) | $1,500 | 90% U.S. |
| Air bags | 25 years (1973-98) | A few hundred dollars | 100% (mandated) |
| Electric vehicles | 100+ years | $10,000+ | Projected 80%+ |

**Key Insight:** Autonomous systems, with a cost premium orders of magnitude higher and far greater complexity, will likely follow a similar, if not longer, adoption cycle. Forecasts of widespread adoption by 2030 are inconsistent with this historical data.

---

# **8. The Unintended Consequence: Induced Travel Demand**

A primary risk identified in the analysis is that AVs could significantly increase Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). By reducing the perceived "cost" of travel (both time and money), AVs risk inducing more demand.
![](data/documents/avip/images/image_12_page_22.png)


**Caption:** This generalized cost curve illustrates a fundamental economic principle: as the total cost per mile decreases, travel demand increases. Private electric AVs, with low variable costs and reclaimed travel time, are positioned to significantly increase VMT, exacerbating congestion.

---

# **9. The Synthesis: Policy Determines the Outcome**

The ultimate impact of AVs is not technologically predetermined. It is a direct function of policy choices. The divergence between an optimistic and pessimistic future is stark.

| Issues | **Optimistic Outcome (Proactive Policy)** | **Pessimistic Outcome (Laissez-Faire)** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Sharing** | Policies encourage vehicle sharing and transit integration. | AVs are promoted as private luxury goods. |
| **Land Use** | Smart Growth policies create dense, walkable communities. | AVs encourage more sprawl. |
| **Planning** | Multi-modal planning favors resource-efficient modes. | Transport planning favors AVs with dedicated lanes and low fees. |

**Key Insight:** A failure to implement proactive policy, particularly Transportation Demand Management (TDM), will likely lead to the pessimistic scenario where AVs amplify existing transport problems.

---

# **10. Strategic Conclusions & Recommendations**

Our analysis indicates that the transition to an autonomous vehicle future will be gradual and that its societal benefit is contingent on deliberate strategy.

1.  **Adjust Timelines:** Planners must operate on a realistic, multi-decade deployment forecast (2040-2060 for mass adoption), not on industry hype.
2.  **Prioritize Policy Over Technology:** The most critical variable for success is not the AV itself, but the regulatory and pricing framework around it.
3.  **Mandate a "Shared First" Approach:** Actively incentivize shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and ridesharing through policy, pricing, and infrastructure to maximize societal benefit and mitigate VMT growth.
4.  **Implement TDM Now:** Strategies like efficient road pricing are essential to manage demand and ensure AVs solve, rather than worsen, congestion.
