# Slide 1: Testing the Phillips Curve: A Cross-Regional Analysis

Conventional macroeconomic theory posits a stable, inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. However, post-2008 data suggests this textbook trade-off, known as the Phillips Curve, is no longer a reliable guide for policy.

This analysis investigates the structural integrity of this relationship. We contrast the United States, a mature economy, with 11 Central and Eastern European (CEE) nations, a region of transitioning economies. The objective is to determine if a universal principle holds or if regional context is the dominant factor.

# Slide 2: The US Case: A Decoupled Relationship

In the US, the long-term data shows a breakdown of the Phillips Curve. When disaggregated by decade, the relationship between inflation and unemployment becomes highly unstable and appears regime-dependent. The signal is lost in the noise.

# Slide 3: The CEE Case: An Inverted Stagflationary Dynamic

Contrary to standard theory, the CEE region exhibits an inverted relationship. Panel VAR analysis reveals that an inflationary shock leads to a statistically significant and persistent *increase* in unemployment. This points to a stagflationary dynamic where rising prices are associated with a weaker labor market.

# Slide 4: Synthesis and Strategic Implications

Our analysis reveals that the inflation-unemployment relationship is not universal but highly context-dependent.

*   **Signal Failure:** The Phillips Curve is an unreliable policy guide. The relationship is non-existent in the US and inverted in the CEE region.
*   **Context is Determinant:** Structural factors in transitioning economies (e.g., supply-side vulnerabilities) can produce stagflationary outcomes where inflation actively harms employment.
*   **The Unifying Principle:** Across both regions, analysis confirms that sustainable GDP growth is the most robust and reliable driver of lower unemployment.

This necessitates a policy shift from managing a theoretical trade-off to a dual focus: ensuring price stability while implementing pro-growth structural reforms.
