## Abstract:

This paper analyzes the relationship between unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI for 11 CEE member countries of the European Union, using annual data from 2000 to 2020. We applied a panel VAR approach in order to estimate impulse response functions to describe the response of an endogenous variable over time to a shock in another variable in the model. We also applied a variance decomposition analysis in order to assess the importance of changes in one variable in explaining changes in other variables. Our results provide evidence for a negative influence of unemployment rate over a period of 2 years to GDP growth shock and a positive response of unemployment to inflation throughout the analyzed period. We also found that FDI does not have a statistically significant influence on the unemployment rate in the CEE countries.

Keywords: unemployment, economic growth, FDI, panel VAR, CEEs economies.

## 1. Introduction

The 1990s can be described as a period of major structural change for the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly due to their transition to a market-based economy. The adopted economic reforms have generated unprecedented unemployment and inflation rates in the region. Therefore, the need for investment to stimulate growth, employment and improve the competitiveness of these countries has been huge. Thus, FDI has been considered a crucial mechanism for restructuring the economy and ensuring economic growth in the context of an efficient integration process into the European Union.

The CEE economies received considerable inflows of FDI after the 1990s and, although they varied across different countries and time periods, they were a significant investment source in transition economies.

Following a period of economic stability, the global economic crisis that began in 2008 had a devastating effect on these countries. The impact of a crisis first manifests itself on the labor market when, in order to reduce costs, companies are adjusting their labor force (Fingleton et al, 2012).

Most  CEE  countries  have  taken  steps  to  expand  and  strengthen  labor  market  policies  and applied  measures  to  support  employment  in  times  of  crisis.  However,  the  scope  of  these measures  has  been  different,  with  some  countries  opting  to  combat  unemployment,  while others have focused on supporting the unemployed by providing professional training. Under these conditions, the analysis of the labor market will support the understanding of a crisis impact, at national level. In order to better understand the impact of the economic recession, we analyzed the labor market conditions in the CEE region.

In the paper we analyze the relationship between unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI for the 11 CEE countries  as EU members (Poland, Romania,  Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia) using annual data from 2000 until 2020. The common ground of these states is the collapse of the communist regime  that  led  to  a  strong  economic  destabilization.  Thus,  a  process  of  transition  from centralized economies to market economies ensued by adopting a set of complex economic reforms.  This  process  has  been  disrupted  by  the  global  recession  in  2008  that  managed  to significantly impact the countries in this region, highlighting their economic vulnerabilities.

This paper is related to the extensive literature on the interaction between the unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI (Balasubramanyam, Salisu and Sapsford, 1999; De Mello, 1999; Li and Liu, 2005; Carkovic and Levine, 2005; Estrin 2017). Our paper contributes to the existing literature on the interaction between the unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI by using a panel vector autoregression (panel VAR) approach, which addresses the endogeneity problem by allowing for the endogenous interaction between the variables in the model (Boubtane et alt., 2012). Also, the panel VAR techniques allowed us to estimate impulse response functions.

The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present a survey of the literature on the relationship between unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI. Section 3 describes the data and the methodology used for the estimation of panel VAR models. In Section 4 we present the empirical analysis for 11 CEE member countries in the European Union, while the last section presents the main conclusions.

## 2. Literature review

The  influence  of  FDI  on  economic  growth  and  employment  in  the  labor  market  has  been highlighted by numerous studies in the literature. Increased FDI inflows stimulate investment in  the  host  economies  which  increases  GDP  levels,  while  also  reducing  unemployment  by creating employment opportunities.

The  rise  of  FDI  in  the  1990s  has  generated  numerous  empirical  research  focused  on  the influence of FDI on economic growth. Empirical evidence on the direct impact of FDI on GDP

growth has rather mixed results (Balasubramanyam, Salisu and Sapsford, 1999; Blomstrom, Lipsey and Zejan, 1994; De Mello, 1999; Li and Liu, 2005; Carkovic and Levine, 2005). Li and Liu (2005) found that there is a positive influence of FDI on GDP growth while Carkovic and Levine (2005) found that this influence is weak or not significant. More recently, Baiashvili and Gattini (2020) studied the impact of FDI on GDP growth for 111 countries by introducing the effect of institutional quality mediated by income level. They found that FDI benefits do not increase mechanically and evenly across countries, they identified an inverted-U shaped relationship between countries' income levels and the size of FDI impact on GDP growth. The effect of FDI is larger for low to middle-income countries.

Given the potential of FDI to increase employment rates in the host country, numerous research studies analyzed the influence of FDI on the labor market. Empirical evidence studying the impact of FDI on employment also show mixed results.

Craigwell (2006) highlighted a positive relationship between FDI and employment, following a study conducted for Caribbean countries for 1990 to 2000. Ajaga and Nunnenkamp (2008) studied  the  long-term  relationship  between  foreign  direct  investment  and  the  economic performance of the USA, finding that FDI have a positive impact on the employment rate. Aktar and Oztuk (2009) investigated the relationship between FDI, gross domestic product, unemployment rate and Turkish  exports  between  2000  and  2007.  According  to  the  results obtained, FDI and GDP change do not help reducing the unemployment rate. Bakkalci and Argin (2013) highlight a direct influence of FDI on employment following a study for the Turkish economy, based on a quarterly data from 2000 to 2011.

Yayli and Deger (2012) conducted a panel analysis for 27 developing countries for the period 1991-2008 and concluded that there is an occasional one-way relationship between foreign direct investment and employment rates on short-term. Habib and Sarwar (2013) showed a positive  impact  of  FDI  on  the  employment  rate  following  a  study  conducted  for  Pakistan between 1970 and 2011.

Stamatiou and Dritsakis (2014) estimated a VECM model to establish the link between the unemployment  rate,  economic  growth  and  FDI  in  Greece  between  1970  and  2012  and concluded that there is a long-term relationship between the three variables. The results of the Granger  causality  test  indicated  the  existence  of  a  unidirectional  relationship  between economic development and foreign direct investment in both the short and long term.

Other  studies  have  shown  that  trade  openness  has  the  role  of  improving  aggregate  labor productivity  with  the  effect  of  reducing  the  unemployment  rate  as  a  result  of  job  creation (Matusz, 1996; Dutt et al., 2009; Felbermayr et al., 2011). Shaari et al. (2012) analyzed the impact  of  foreign  direct  investment  on  unemployment  and  economic  growth  in  Malaysia between 1980 and 2010 and concluded that FDI contributes to reducing the unemployment rate and  increasing  gross  domestic  product.  However,  different  authors  have  obtained  different results. Janiak (2010) found that trade exposure leads to higher unemployment due to the high number of jobs lost as a result of the number of companies leaving the market due to low levels of productivity to the detriment of high productivity companies. Other authors point out that

trade  openness  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  long-term  unemployment  rate  (Egger  and Kreickemeier, 2009; Helpman and Itskhoki, 2010; Velnampy et al. 2013).

FDI was seen as an important mechanism for restructuring the economy and ensuring economic growth in the Central and East European countries that engaged in the transition to a market economy after the 1990s. The impact of FDI on economic growth and labor market has been the subject of numerous studies in the literature.

A positive and significant effect on economic growth was found by Campos and Kinoshita (2002) in a study of the impact of FDI on economic growth made on 25 Central and Eastern European and former Soviet Union transition economies between 1990-1998.

Balcerzak and Zurek (2011) studied the influence of FDI on the Polish labor market in the period 1995-2009 using the VAR methodology. The results showed that in the short term, the impulse of foreign direct investment has led to a decrease in the unemployment rate.

Strat  and  al.  (2015),  using  data  from  1991  -  2012,  analyzed  the  short  run  causal  relations between the inflows of foreign direct investments (net inflows) and the unemployment rate for the latest thirteen member states of the European Union. They found that there is a causality relation running from FDI towards the unemployment for four of the thirteen studied countries (Hungary, Malta, Bulgaria and Estonia) and from the unemployment towards the FDI for other three countries (Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia).

Estrin (2017) conducted a study on a larger sample of transitioning economies and found that FDI inflows have been substantial, though variable across countries and were associated with higher levels of GDP and lower unemployment for some periods. But these differences are most likely explained by EU membership and domestic policies, especially concerning public institutions.  Other  authors  found  empirical  evidence  for  the  positive  effect  of  technology transfer on the productivity of domestic firms (Sinani and Meyer, 2004).

Other  studies  focused  on  the  impact  of  host  countries'  competitiveness  on  FDI  to  capture changes in the important factors for FDI location (Horobeț et al., 2021; Vancea et al., 2021). The results obtained highlight that the countries' particularities, market size, digitalization of the economy, labour force characteristics and economic market potential are the factors with the highest contribution in attracting FDI in the CEE countries.

## 3. Data and methodology

In this paper we study the relationship between unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI  from  11  Central  and  Eastern  European  countries  (CEECs),  namely  Poland,  Romania, Bulgaria,  Hungary,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Estonia,  Croatia,  Czech  Republic,  Slovenia  and Slovakia. We used data ranging from 2000 until 2020, a period when the economies of these countries can be labeled as market economies. The data sources are the Eurostat and World Bank.

In the paper we follow the methodological approach based on panel VAR models, being one of  the  most  used  methods  of  time  series  analysis.  These  models  are  also  considered  a

generalization of simultaneous equations, taking into account that a system of equations that captures the interconnections between the variables used is estimated simultaneously.

The variables used to conduct this study are the unemployment rate (%), the GDP growth rate (euro, calculated in constant 2010 prices), foreign direct investment (% of GDP), the inflation, calculated as the growth rate of the consumer price index, expressed in constant prices based on 2010. We also created a dummy variable to capture the period generated by the economic crisis of 2008 and a dummy variable that captures the effects generated by the current health crisis generated by COVID-19.

The panel VAR (PVAR) model has the following form:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where Xit is a vector of stationary variables, B(L) is a polynomial matrix with the lag operator L , ai is a vector of country specific effects. The term ε is the error term, i indicates the countries and t the time period.

The first step of the analysis is to test the stationarity of the variables. We perform several unit root  tests  using  second  generation  tests  which  relax  the  assumption  of  cross-sectional independence (Levin et al., 2002; Im, Pesaran and Shin (2003).

Given that all the variables are integrated of order zero, we explore the dynamic relationships between these variables using a PVAR model. The choice of the optimal number of lags was made using the Hannan-Quinn information criterion.

In order to describe the response of an endogenous variable over time to a shock in another variable in the system we compute the impulse response functions by applying a Cholesky decomposition.  Finally,  in  order  to  assess  the  importance  of  changes  in  one  variable  in explaining changes in other variables we made a variance decomposition analysis.

## 4. Empirical results

The empirical study performed in this paper concerns the relationship between unemployment, economic growth, inflation and FDI from 11 Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), using annual data from 2000 until 2020. Before the presentation of results, in Section 4.1 we undertake a brief description of the variables taken under consideration. The results of panel VAR estimations are presented in Section 4.2.

## 4.1. Dataset Description

The graphical representation for our variables is reported below.

The  global  economic  crisis  has  had  an  impact  on  unemployment  in  Central  and  Eastern European countries. Thus, starting with 2008 the unemployment rate followed an upward trend until 2010, in all the countries in the region, while in some countries it continued until 2013 (Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland and Slovenia). Estonia was one of the countries most affected by the economic crisis, where the unemployment rate rose from 5.5% in 2008 to 13.5% in

2009,  Lithuania  and  Latvia  occupying  the  following  positions,  with  unemployment  rates rising by about 2.3 times in 2009 compared to 2008.

Comparing the unemployment rate recorded in 2015 with the one recorded in 2008, it can be observed that Slovenia, Croatia and Bulgaria encountered the greatest difficulties in restoring a post-crisis balance. Thus, in Slovenia the unemployment rate increased from 4.4% in 2008 to 9.0% in 2015, in Croatia from 8.6% to 16.2% and in Bulgaria from 5.6% to 9.2%. On the other hand, Hungary is the only country in Central and Eastern Europe where the unemployment rate recorded in 2015 (6.8%) is lower than in 2008 (7.8%), showing that the economic policies and programs applied led to a decrease in the unemployment rate.

Figure 1 . The evolution of unemployment rate in the CEE countries

<!-- image -->

According  to  figure  1,  since  2014,  unemployment  rates  in  the  CEE  countries  followed  a downward trend until 2019, just before the health crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, in 2020 Estonia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic recorded the highest unemployment growth rates compared to 2019, of all the analyzed countries. At the opposite end is Poland, where  unemployment  levels  maintained  constant  in  2020  compared  to  2019.  In  2020,  the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.6%), Poland (3.2%) and

Hungary  (4.3%),  positioning  themselves  below  the  average  registered  at  the  level  of  CEE countries.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of economic growth between 2000 to 2020. From an economic point of view, the countries in Central and Eastern Europe have entered in recession since 2009 as a result of the global economic crisis launched in 2008. The most affected countries were Romania, Poland and Hungary, registering the largest decreases in GDP in 2009 compared to 2008. The peak points of GDP growth rates are evident in the years before the global crisis, but since 2010 the economies of the 11 states have shown signs of recovery. In the 2015-2019 period,  the  GDP  registered  fluctuating  growth  rates  in  all  CEE  countries  compared  to  the previous year. In 2020, significant decreases in gross domestic product compared to 2019 can be observed, Hungary (-11.7%), Croatia (-9.6%) and Czech Republic (-8.6) being the most affected.

Inflation, defined by the consumer price index, represents the change in the prices of a basket of goods and services taking into consideration the prices paid by a reference group over the years. Figure 3 shows that the highest inflation levels in the CEE countries were recorded in Romania between 2000 and 2003 (45.7% in 2000, 15.3% in 2003). In 2005, the National Bank of  Romania  adopted  a  system  of  direct  inflation  targeting  in  the  context  of  preparing  for

adherence to the European Union, which led to decreases in the indicator in the following period.

The year 2008 is characterized by high inflation rate levels in all CEE countries, especially in Latvia (15.4%), Bulgaria (12.3%), Lithuania (10.9%) and Estonia (10.4%), these also represent the maximum points of inflation for these countries between 2000 - 2020. In 2020, out of the 11 countries analyzed, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic recorded the highest inflation rates, while Estonia and Slovenia recorded the lowest levels of inflation.

Foreign direct investment is considered by the governments of developing countries to be one of  the  main  drivers  of  economic  stimulus.  Thus,  for  emerging  economies,  respectively  for countries in transition, foreign investment  represents the engine for economic development strategy,  raising  living  standards,  increasing  the  wage  level  and  creating  new  jobs.  The countries where the FDI levels increases benefit from a number of advantages, among which we can list: the promotion of economic growth and productivity growth, the transfer of new technologies, the promotion of international trade, respectively the creation of new jobs.

Foreign  direct  investment  levels  recorded  between  2000  and  2020  fluctuates  in  the  CEE countries. Thus, in the period between 2006-2007, high FDI values are highlighted in Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Poland and Romania (Figure 4).

Figure 4 . The evolution FDI in the CEE countries

<!-- image -->

Although the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has led to declining FDI compared to 2019  in  countries  such  as  Croatia,  the  Czech  Republic,  Latvia,  Romania,  Slovakia  and Slovenia,  while  in  Hungary  foreign  direct  investment  has  increased  significantly.  The Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA) has contributed to the implementation of numerous investment projects that have led to the creation of new jobs.

## 4.2. Panel VAR models

The estimation of the VAR model involves several steps. Firstly, we tested the stationarity of the variables using Levin, Lin &amp; Chu (LLC) and Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS) tests, afterwards we chose the optimal number of lags for the VAR model and we analyzed the results of Granger causality test. In the final step, we represented the impulse response function and we performed the variance decomposition analysis.

## 4.2.1 Panel unit root tests

The  first  step  of  the  analysis  is  to  determine  the  properties  of  the  data  series  used.  The stationarity hypothesis of the variables was tested using several panel unit root tests (Levin, Lin &amp; Chu (LLC), 2002; Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS), 2003). The results of these tests, for all the variables of our model, are presented in table 1.

Table 1. The results of panel unit root tests

|                   |                    | LLC        | LLC      | IPS        | IPS      |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
|                   | Model              | Stat. test | Prob.    | Stat. test | Prob.    |
| Unemployment rate | Constant           | -4.97      | 0.000*** | -3.99      | 0.000*** |
| Unemployment rate | Constant and trend | -3.93      | 0.000*** | -3.88      | 0.000*** |
| GDP               | Constant           | -3.66      | 0.000*** | -3.87      | 0.000*** |
| GDP               | Constant and trend | -3.09      | 0.001*** | -2.77      | 0.003*** |
|                   | Constant           | -5.00      | 0.000*** | -4.29      | 0.000*** |
|                   | Constant and trend | -4.86      | 0.000*** | -3.28      | 0.001*** |
|                   | Constant           | -2.21      | 0.014**  | -3.19      | 0.001*** |
|                   | Constant and trend | -1.63      | 0.051*   | -2.30      | 0.011**  |

***p&lt;0.01; **p&lt;0.05; *p&lt;0.1.

At  conventional  levels  of  significance,  the  results  of  panel  unit  root  test  show  that  all  the variables are stationary in levels.

The next step of the VAR methodology involves establishing the optimal number of lags that will be included in the model. In order to correctly identify the number of lags of the model, several informational criteria will be used, the results being presented in table 2.

Table 2. Lag length criteria

|   Lag | AIC       | SC        | HQ        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|     0 | 23.99048  | 24.21636  | 24.08217  |
|     1 | 21.27422  | 21.80129  | 21.48817  |
|     2 | 20.86073  | 21.68898* | 21.19694  |
|     3 | 20.69976  | 21.82919  | 21.15823* |
|     4 | 20.76087  | 22.19149  | 21.34161  |
|     5 | 20.69231  | 22.42411  | 21.39531  |
|     6 | 20.55633* | 22.58931  | 21.38158  |

According to table 2, the Schwarz criterion records the lowest values for a VAR(2) model, the Hannan-Quinn criterion for a VAR(3) model and the Akaike criterion for the VAR(6) model. The analysis of the relationship between the unemployment rate, economic growth, inflation and foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern Europe region will be performed using a VAR(3) model.

## 4.2.2. Causality relationship between variables (Granger test)

The Granger causality test is applied to determine the impact of the GDP growth rate, foreign direct investment and inflation on the unemployment rate in the CEE countries. The results of the Granger test are shown in the table below:

Table 3. Granger causality test

| Null Hypothesis:                                                     |    Chi-sq |   Prob. |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| GDP growth rate does not Granger Cause                               | 25.2334   |  0      |
| Unemployment rate Inflation rate does not Granger Cause Unemployment | 42.2884   |  0      |
| rate FDI does not Granger Cause Unemployment rate                    |  1.14351  |  0.7666 |
| Unemployment rate does not Granger Cause GDP                         |  3.65018  |  0.3018 |
| growth rate Unemployment rate does not Granger Cause Inflation       |  5.34779  |  0.148  |
| rate Unemployment rate does not Granger Cause FDI                    |  0.954303 |  0.8123 |

The results suggest that the growth rate of gross domestic product influences the unemployment rate, but unemployment does not impact GDP growth. It can thus be concluded that there is a unidirectional relationship between the 2 variables. The same can be said about the relationship between unemployment rate and inflation. Regarding the foreign direct investment, it can be stated  that  they  do  not  have  a  statistically  significant  impact  on  unemployment  in  the  11 countries.

## 4.2.3. Impulse response function

The impulse response function is used to describe the effect of the shock administered to a variable on the future values of each of the other variables included in the model. The role of this function is to follow the evolution, over a time period, of these effects.

The impulse response functions are represented in the figure below.

Response to Cholesky One S.D. Innovations ± 2 S.E.

Figure 5 . Impulse response functions

<!-- image -->

According to Figure 5, the unemployment rate responds negatively to the impulse given by the GDP growth rate over a period of 2 years, followed by an upward trend that stabilizes over time. Also, a shock of one standard deviation on foreign direct investment leads to a decrease

in unemployment in Central and Eastern European countries for a period of 4 years, but this decrease is statistically insignificant. Starting with the 5th period, the unemployment rate rises slightly, reaching a constant level towards the end of the period.

Regarding the relationship between inflation and unemployment, it can be observed that an increase  in  inflation  generates  a  positive  response  on  the  unemployment  rate  reaching  a maximum increase of 0.8% after 3 years. The relationship between the two variables remains positive  throughout  the  analyzed  period  after  the  shock,  but  starting  with  the  4th  year  a downward trend is registered.

## 4.2.4. Variance decomposition

Impulse response functions proved to be  efficient  in  offering  useful  information  about  the influence of changes in a variable after applying a shock of one standard deviation to another variable, but this analysis fails to capture the importance of shocks in explaining the fluctuation of variables. Thus, it is necessary to perform an analysis of variance decomposition in order to determine the importance of individual shocks on changes in the variables of the study.

The  results  presented  in  table  4  provides  the  forecast  error  variance  decomposition  of unemployment to GDP growth, inflation and FDI shocks. The output is in line with the patterns of impulse response function. In the 2 nd year, the inflation rate and GDP growth shocks account for 6.43%, respectively 1.03% of the unemployment volatility. Also, the results of variance decomposition show that the impact of FDI does not significantly explain the variation of the unemployment  rate  after  2  years  (0.15%).  After  10  periods,  the  results  highlight  that  the variation of the unemployment rate is attributed to the inflation rate by 23.39%, to GDP growth by 5.4% and to FDI shocks only by 1.63%.

## 4.2.6. Stability testing of the VAR model

In order to determine if the VAR model has been estimated correctly, it is necessary to test the stability of the model. If the estimated model is stable and correctly specified, then the values of the root of the polynomial determinant in mode are less than 1 and are inside the unit circle Figure 6).

Figure 6 suggests that the estimated model is stable because none of the values are positioned outside the unit circle.

The  validation  of  the  estimated  model  has  been  performed  by  testing  the  hypothesis  of independence  of  the  modelling  errors -  the  LM  test  indicating  that  the  model  errors  are independent.

## 5. Conclusions

Unemployment in the CEE region started to grow significantly in 2009 - 2010, shortly after the beginning of the global recession in 2008, reaching maximum levels between 2011 - 2014. Starting with 2014, the unemployment rates in the CEE region follow a downward trend until 2019. In 2020 Estonia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic registered the highest unemployment growth rates compared to 2019.

The  global  recession  also  impacted  the  GDP  in  the  CEE  region.  GDP  growth  decreased drastically starting with 2009 compared to 2008 - on average it decreased by 11.5%, Romania having been the most affected in the region with a decrease of 17.9%, followed by Poland (16.5%) and Hungary (-16.2%). GDP growth rates have been modest between 2009 and 2015, being on average close to 0. Starting with 2015, GDP started to gain traction in the CEE region, increasing until 2019 by 3.6% on average. In 2020 GDP growth reached a turning point in the CEE region, averaging a decrease of 5.5%, Hungary and Croatia being the most affected by COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

Inflation levels reached new highs in 2008 altogether with the start of the global recession. The highest values were registered in Latvia (15.4%), Bulgaria (12.3%), Lithuania (10.9%) and Estonia (10.4%). Between 2009 and 2019 moderate levels of inflation were maintained in the CEE region, averaging 1.9% (highest levels being reached in Romania in 2010 - 6.1% and 2011 - 5.8%). 2020 was a turning point regarding inflation levels in the region, Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic recording the highest levels of inflation from CEE region.

This article analyzes the impact of economic growth, inflation, and foreign direct investment on the unemployment rate in Central and Eastern European countries between 2000 and 2020. The empirical study consisted in estimating a VAR model, the main results showing a one-way relationship between inflation, respectively the growth rate of the GDP and the unemployment rate.  Another  objective  of  the  study  was  to  test  the  relationship  between  foreign  direct investment and unemployment, the results of the Granger test highlighting that there is no causal relationship between the two variables.

The response of the unemployment rate to a shock of one standard deviation on GDP growth is  negative,  with  a  decrease  of  maximum  0.2%  in  the  second  year.  A  decrease  in  the unemployment rate can be observed in the case of a shock in FDI for a period of 4 years, but this decrease is statistically insignificant. Regarding the inflation-unemployment relationship, the impulse response function highlights a positive response in unemployment for the entire analyzed period.
