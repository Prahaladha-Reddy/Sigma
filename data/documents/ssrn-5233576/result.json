Document Overview\n\n-   **Document type:** Research article.\n-   **Main purpose or goal of the document:** To analyze the dynamic relationships between unemployment, economic growth (GDP growth), inflation (CPI growth), and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 11 Central and Eastern European (CEE) member countries of the European Union. The study aims to provide panel VAR evidence for these relationships.\n-   **Approximate scope:**\n    -   Number of pages: 16.\n    -   High-level topics covered: Macroeconomic dynamics in CEE countries, transition economies, the impact of economic crises (2008 global crisis, COVID-19), panel Vector Autoregression (VAR) methodology, unit root tests, Granger causality, impulse response functions, variance decomposition, and model stability.\n-   **One paragraph high-level summary:** This research article investigates the interconnections between unemployment, economic growth, inflation, and FDI in 11 CEE EU countries from 2000 to 2020 using a panel VAR approach. The study finds a unidirectional causality from GDP growth and inflation to unemployment. Specifically, unemployment responds negatively to GDP growth shocks over a two-year period and positively to inflation shocks throughout the analyzed period. A notable finding is the statistically insignificant influence of FDI on the unemployment rate in these CEE economies. The paper uses impulse response functions and variance decomposition to detail these dynamic relationships and their magnitudes.\n\n## 2. Detailed Section-by-Section Summary\n\n-   **Title and Authorship** (Page 1)\n    -   **Page range:** 1\n    -   **Summary:** The document is titled \"Unemployment, Economic Growth, Inflation and FDI. Panel VAR evidence for Central and Eastern European Union countries.\" It lists three authors: Nicoleta PANAITE, Carmen PINTILESCU, and Nicoleta PROHOZESCU (IFTIMI), all affiliated with Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, Romania, or its Doctoral School. Their email addresses are provided.\n\n-   **Abstract** (Page 1)\n    -   **Page range:** 1\n    -   **Summary:** The abstract outlines the paper's objective: to analyze the relationship between unemployment, economic growth, inflation, and FDI for 11 CEE EU member countries using annual data from 2000 to 2020. The methodology involves a panel VAR approach, including impulse response functions and variance decomposition analysis. Key findings indicate a negative influence of the unemployment rate over a two-year period in response to a GDP growth shock, and a positive response of unemployment to inflation throughout the period. Crucially, FDI is found to have no statistically significant influence on the unemployment rate in these countries. The section also lists keywords (unemployment, economic growth, FDI, panel VAR, CEEs economies) and J.E.L. Classification codes (J61, F40, C33).\n\n-   **1. Introduction** (Page 1-2)\n    -   **Page range:** 1-2\n    -   **Summary:** This section sets the historical and economic context for the study. It describes the 1990s as a period of significant structural change for CEE countries transitioning to market economies, leading to high unemployment and inflation. FDI was considered vital for growth, employment, and EU integration. These economies experienced considerable FDI inflows after the 1990s. The 2008 global economic crisis significantly impacted these countries, particularly their labor markets. The paper focuses on 11 CEE EU members (Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Slovakia) from 2000-2020. It highlights the unique economic journey of these states, marked by post-communist transition and vulnerability to global recessions. The study contributes to existing literature by using a panel VAR approach to address endogeneity and estimate impulse response functions for unemployment, economic growth, inflation, and FDI. The section concludes by outlining the paper's structure.\n\n-   **2. Literature review** (Page 2-4)\n    -   **Page range:** 2-4\n    -   **Summary:** This section reviews prior empirical studies on the relationship between FDI, economic growth, and employment. It notes that evidence on FDI's impact on GDP growth is mixed, with some studies finding positive influence (e.g., Li and Liu, 2005) while others find it weak or insignificant (e.g., Carkovic and Levine, 2005). More recent work (Baiashvili and Gattini, 2020) suggests an inverted-U shaped relationship, with larger FDI impacts for low-to-middle income countries. Similarly, the impact of FDI on employment shows mixed results: some studies report a positive relationship (Craigwell, 2006; Ajaga and Nunnenkamp, 2008; Habib and Sarwar, 2013), while others find no reduction in unemployment (Aktar and Oztuk, 2009). Studies also discuss the role of trade openness, with some linking it to reduced unemployment (Matusz, 1996) and others to increased long-term unemployment (Egger and Kreickemeier, 2009). For CEE countries specifically, FDI was seen as crucial for economic restructuring. Campos and Kinoshita (2002) found a positive effect on economic growth. Balcerzak and Zurek (2011) showed short-term FDI leading to decreased unemployment in Poland. Strat et al. (2015) found mixed causality between FDI and unemployment across 13 EU member states. Estrin (2017) noted substantial but variable FDI inflows in transition economies, linked to higher GDP and lower unemployment, often explained by EU membership and domestic policies.\n\n-   **3. Data and methodology** (Page 4-5)\n    -   **Page range:** 4-5\n    -   **Summary:** This section details the data and econometric approach. The study covers 11 CEE EU countries (listed in the introduction) from 2000 to 2020, using annual data from Eurostat and World Bank. The variables are:\n        -   Unemployment rate (%).\n        -   GDP growth rate (euro, constant 2010 prices).\n        -   Foreign direct investment (% of GDP).\n        -   Inflation (growth rate of consumer price index, constant 2010 prices).\n        -   Two dummy variables for the 2008 economic crisis and the COVID-19 health crisis.\n    The methodology is based on panel VAR (PVAR) models, described by the equation Xit = ai + B(L)Xit + Eit, where Xit is a vector of stationary variables, B(L) is a polynomial matrix with lag operator L, ai are country-specific effects, and \u025b is the error term. The analysis steps include:\n        1.  **Stationarity tests:** Using second-generation panel unit root tests (Levin et al., 2002; Im, Pesaran and Shin, 2003) which relax cross-sectional independence.\n        2.  **Optimal lag selection:** Determined using information criteria, specifically Hannan-Quinn.\n        3.  **Impulse response functions:** Computed using Cholesky decomposition to describe variable responses to shocks.\n        4.  **Variance decomposition analysis:** Performed to assess the importance of changes in one variable in explaining changes in others.\n\n-   **4. Empirical results** (Page 5)\n    -   **Page range:** 5\n    -   **Summary:** This section introduces the presentation of the empirical findings. It indicates that the following subsections will describe the dataset and then present the results of the panel VAR estimations.\n\n-   **4.1. Dataset Description** (Page 5-8)\n    -   **Page range:** 5-8\n    -   **Summary:** This subsection provides a descriptive overview of the variables through graphical representations for each of the 11 CEE countries.\n        -   **Unemployment Rate (Figure 1, Page 6):** Shows an upward trend from 2008 to 2010 (or 2013 for some, like Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Slovenia) due to the global economic crisis. Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia experienced significant increases. Hungary was the only country where the 2015 unemployment rate was lower than in 2008. Post-2014, rates generally declined until 2019, but rose again in 2020 due to COVID-19, with Estonia, Lithuania, and Czech Republic seeing the highest increases. Czech Republic (2.6%) and Poland (3.2%) recorded the lowest rates in 2020.\n        -   **GDP Growth Rate (Figure 2, Page 7):** Indicates a recessionary period starting in 2009 post-2008 crisis, with Romania, Poland, and Hungary most affected. Post-2010 saw recovery, with fluctuating growth until 2019. In 2020, significant decreases were observed, particularly in Hungary (-11.7%), Croatia (-9.6%), and Czech Republic (-8.6%) due to COVID-19.\n        -   **Inflation (Figure 3, Page 8):** Characterized by high rates in 2008 across all CEE countries, especially Latvia (15.4%), Bulgaria (12.3%), Lithuania (10.9%), and Estonia (10.4%). Romania had the highest inflation early in the period (45.7% in 2000). Between 2009 and 2019, moderate levels prevailed. In 2020, Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic recorded the highest inflation rates.\n        -   **FDI (Figure 4, Page 9):** FDI levels fluctuated between 2000 and 2020, with high values in 2006-2007 in Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. COVID-19 led to declining FDI in most countries in 2020, except Hungary which saw a significant increase due to investment promotion efforts.\n\n-   **4.2. Panel VAR models** (Page 9)\n    -   **Page range:** 9\n    -   **Summary:** This subsection outlines the steps taken for the Panel VAR model estimation, including stationarity tests, optimal lag selection, Granger causality tests, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition analysis.\n\n-   **4.2.1 Panel unit root tests** (Page 10)\n    -   **Page range:** 10\n    -   **Summary:** The initial step involved testing the stationarity of all variables using Levin, Lin & Chu (LLC) and Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS) panel unit root tests. Table 1 (Page 10) presents the results, showing that all variables (Unemployment rate, GDP growth rate, CPI growth rate, FDI) are stationary in levels at conventional significance levels (p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.1), both with constant and constant and trend specifications. This justifies proceeding with the PVAR model in levels. The optimal number of lags for the VAR model was then determined using informational criteria. Table 2 (Page 10) indicates that Schwarz criterion suggests VAR(2), Hannan-Quinn suggests VAR(3), and Akaike suggests VAR(6). The study chose to proceed with a VAR(3) model for the analysis of the relationships.\n\n-   **4.2.2. Causality relationship between variables (Granger test)** (Page 11)\n    -   **Page range:** 11\n    -   **Summary:** The Granger causality test was applied to investigate the causal relationships between GDP growth rate, FDI, inflation, and unemployment. Table 3 (Page 11) shows the results:\n        -   GDP growth rate Granger causes unemployment (Chi-sq 25.23335, Prob. 0.0000).\n        -   Inflation rate Granger causes unemployment (Chi-sq 42.28839, Prob. 0.0000).\n        -   FDI does not Granger cause unemployment rate (Prob. 0.7666).\n        -   Unemployment rate does not Granger cause GDP (Prob. 0.3018), inflation (Prob. 0.1480), or FDI (Prob. 0.8123).\n    These results indicate a unidirectional relationship from GDP growth and inflation to unemployment. Foreign direct investment does not have a statistically significant impact on unemployment.\n\n-   **4.2.3. Impulse response function** (Page 11-12)\n    -   **Page range:** 11-12\n    -   **Summary:** The impulse response functions (Figure 5, Page 11) illustrate the dynamic effect of shocks.\n        -   **Unemployment to GDP Growth Shock:** The unemployment rate responds negatively to a one standard deviation shock in GDP growth for approximately 2 years, with a maximum decrease of 0.2% in the second year. After this, it registers a slight upward trend, stabilizing over time.\n        -   **Unemployment to FDI Shock:** A one standard deviation shock on foreign direct investment leads to a decrease in unemployment for about 4 years, but this decrease is statistically insignificant. From the 5th period onwards, the unemployment rate slightly rises and stabilizes.\n        -   **Unemployment to Inflation Shock:** An increase in inflation generates a positive response on the unemployment rate, reaching a maximum increase of 0.8% after 3 years. The positive relationship persists throughout the analyzed period, although a downward trend is observed from the 4th year.\n\n-   **4.2.4. Variance decomposition** (Page 12)\n    -   **Page range:** 12\n    -   **Summary:** The variance decomposition analysis (Table 4, Page 12) quantifies the proportion of the forecast error variance of unemployment explained by shocks in GDP growth, inflation, and FDI.\n        -   In the 2nd year, inflation shocks account for 6.43% of unemployment volatility, while GDP growth shocks account for 1.03%. FDI shocks contribute only 0.15%, confirming its statistically insignificant impact.\n        -   After 10 periods, inflation accounts for 23.39% of unemployment variation, GDP growth for 5.4%, and FDI shocks for a minor 1.63%. The largest portion of unemployment variation is still explained by its own past shocks, diminishing over time from 100% in period 1 to 69.58% in period 10.\n\n-   **4.2.6. Stability testing of the VAR model** (Page 12-13)\n    -   **Page range:** 12-13\n    -   **Summary:** To ensure the reliability of the VAR model, stability tests were performed. Figure 6 (Page 13) shows the inverse roots of the AR characteristic polynomial. All roots are positioned inside the unit circle, indicating that the estimated model is stable and correctly specified. Additionally, the LM test was used to validate the model's errors, confirming their independence.\n\n-   **5. Conclusions** (Page 13-14)\n    -   **Page range:** 13-14\n    -   **Summary:** This section summarizes the main findings and provides a narrative recap of the economic trends in CEE countries.\n        -   **Unemployment:** Increased significantly post-2008 crisis (2009-2010), peaking between 2011-2014, then trended downwards until 2019. In 2020, Estonia, Lithuania, and Czech Republic saw the highest unemployment growth rates.\n        -   **GDP Growth:** Decreased drastically in 2009 (Romania, Poland, Hungary most affected), with modest growth until 2015, then gained traction until 2019. In 2020, GDP growth reached a turning point with an average decrease of 5.5%, Hungary and Croatia being most affected by COVID-19.\n        -   **Inflation:** Reached new highs in 2008 (Latvia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Estonia highest). Moderate levels prevailed from 2009-2019. In 2020, Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic recorded the highest inflation levels.\n        -   **Model Results:** The empirical study confirmed a one-way relationship from inflation and GDP growth rate to unemployment. GDP growth negatively impacts unemployment (maximum decrease of 0.2% in the second year). Inflation positively affects unemployment throughout the period. FDI's influence on unemployment was found to be statistically insignificant based on both Granger causality and impulse response functions.\n\n-   **References** (Page 14-16)\n    -   **Page range:** 14-16\n    -   **Summary:** This section provides a comprehensive list of academic papers, working papers, and data sources cited throughout the document, including URLs for Eurostat and World Bank data accessed in January 2022.\n\n## 3. Key Ideas, Claims, and Takeaways\n\n-   **Key Idea 1 \u2013 Unidirectional Causality to Unemployment**\n    The study conclusively demonstrates a unidirectional Granger causality from both GDP growth and inflation to the unemployment rate in CEE countries. This means changes in economic growth and inflation can predict changes in unemployment, but not vice-versa. This is a central finding regarding the macroeconomic relationships in these transition economies.\n    (Page 11, Section 4.2.2. Causality relationship between variables (Granger test); Page 14, Section 5. Conclusions)\n    Evidence: Table 3 (Page 11) shows significant probability values (0.0000) for \"GDP growth rate does not Granger Cause Unemployment\" and \"Inflation rate does not Granger Cause Unemployment\" null hypotheses to be rejected, while the reverse is not true.\n\n-   **Key Idea 2 \u2013 Negative Unemployment Response to GDP Growth Shocks**\n    An impulse (one standard deviation shock) in GDP growth rate leads to a negative response in the unemployment rate. This effect is observed over approximately two years, with a maximum decrease of 0.2% in the second year, before stabilizing. This implies that stronger economic growth helps reduce unemployment in the short to medium term.\n    (Page 11, Section 4.2.3. Impulse response function; Page 14, Section 5. Conclusions)\n    Evidence: Figure 5 (Page 11), panel \"Response of UNEMPLOYMENT to GDP_GROWTH\", clearly shows the unemployment line dropping below zero for the first two periods after the shock. Variance decomposition (Table 4, Page 12) shows GDP growth contributing 1.03% to unemployment volatility in year 2, and 5.4% over 10 years.\n\n-   **Key Idea 3 \u2013 Positive Unemployment Response to Inflation Shocks**\n    A shock in inflation generates a positive response in the unemployment rate, meaning increased inflation is associated with higher unemployment. This positive relationship persists throughout the analyzed period, peaking at an increase of 0.8% after three years. This challenges the traditional Phillips curve inverse relationship in this context.\n    (Page 12, Section 4.2.3. Impulse response function; Page 14, Section 5. Conclusions)\n    Evidence: Figure 5 (Page 11), panel \"Response of UNEMPLOYMENT to INFLATION\", shows the unemployment line rising above zero after the inflation shock. Variance decomposition (Table 4, Page 12) shows inflation contributing 6.43% to unemployment volatility in year 2, and 23.39% over 10 years, making it the largest external contributor.\n\n-   **Key Idea 4 \u2013 Insignificant Influence of FDI on Unemployment**\n    Contrary to some expectations, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) does not have a statistically significant influence on the unemployment rate in the studied CEE countries. Both Granger causality tests and impulse response functions support this finding, indicating that while FDI shocks might initially lead to a slight, temporary decrease in unemployment, this effect is not statistically significant.\n    (Page 11, Section 4.2.2. Causality relationship between variables (Granger test); Page 11-12, Section 4.2.3. Impulse response function; Page 14, Section 5. Conclusions)\n    Evidence: Table 3 (Page 11) shows a high probability (0.7666) for \"FDI does not Granger Cause Unemployment rate\" null hypothesis, meaning it cannot be rejected. Figure 5 (Page 11), panel \"Response of UNEMPLOYMENT to FDI\", shows a decrease but is explicitly stated as \"statistically insignificant.\" Variance decomposition (Table 4, Page 12) shows a very minor contribution of FDI to unemployment volatility (0.15% in year 2, 1.63% over 10 years).\n\n-   **Key Idea 5 \u2013 Economic Context of CEE Countries (2000-2020)**\n    The document emphasizes that the period 2000-2020 for the CEE countries was marked by their transition to market economies, susceptibility to global economic crises (2008) and health crises (COVID-19), and varying degrees of recovery and macroeconomic stability. Understanding these unique dynamics is crucial for interpreting the relationships between macroeconomic variables.\n    (Page 1, Section 1. Introduction; Page 5-9, Section 4.1. Dataset Description; Page 13, Section 5. Conclusions)\n    Evidence: The entire \"Introduction\" section sets this context. Section 4.1, with Figures 1-4, visually illustrates the trends and impacts of these crises on unemployment, GDP growth, inflation, and FDI across the region.\n\n## 4. Important Tables (with page numbers)\n\n-   **Table ID:** Table 1\n-   **Page:** 10\n-   **Title/Caption:** The results of panel unit root tests\n-   **What it shows (content):** This table presents the statistical results for panel unit root tests (Levin, Lin & Chu - LLC, and Im, Pesaran and Shin - IPS) for all four variables: Unemployment rate, GDP growth rate, CPI growth rate, and FDI. For each variable, tests are run with \"Constant\" and \"Constant and trend\" specifications. The table shows the \"Stat. test\" value and the corresponding \"Prob.\" (probability) value. All probability values are very low (mostly 0.000***, 0.001***, 0.014**, 0.051*, 0.011**), indicating strong rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root at conventional significance levels (1%, 5%, 10%).\n-   **Why it is important:** This table is crucial because it establishes that all variables used in the study are stationary in levels. This is a fundamental prerequisite for applying the Panel VAR methodology, as VAR models typically require stationary variables to avoid spurious regression results. It directly supports the methodological choices made in the paper and ensures the validity of subsequent analyses like impulse response functions and variance decomposition. It is linked to **Key Idea 1**.\n\n-   **Table ID:** Table 2\n-   **Page:** 10\n-   **Title/Caption:** Lag length criteria\n-   **What it shows (content):** This table displays the values of three information criteria (Akaike Information Criterion - AIC, Schwarz Criterion - SC, and Hannan-Quinn Criterion - HQ) for different lag lengths (0 to 6) of the Panel VAR model. The criteria help determine the optimal number of lags to include in the model. SC suggests a VAR(2) model (lowest value at lag 2), HQ suggests a VAR(3) model (lowest value at lag 3), and AIC suggests a VAR(6) model (lowest value at lag 6). The authors chose a VAR(3) model based on these criteria.\n-   **Why it is important:** This table is essential for the proper specification of the Panel VAR model. Choosing the correct lag length is vital for capturing the dynamic relationships between variables accurately without overfitting or underfitting the model. It directly impacts the reliability of the impulse response functions and variance decomposition results. This table supports the methodological choice discussed in Section 3 and 4.2.1.\n\n-   **Table ID:** Table 3\n-   **Page:** 11\n-   **Title/Caption:** Granger causality test\n-   **What it shows (content):** This table presents the results of the Granger causality test, examining whether one variable can predict another. It lists several \"Null Hypothesis\" statements, such as \"GDP growth rate does not Granger Cause Unemployment,\" along with their corresponding Chi-squared (\"Chi-sq\") statistics and probability (\"Prob.\") values.\n    -   The null hypotheses that GDP growth and inflation *do not* Granger cause unemployment are rejected (Prob. 0.0000), indicating causality.\n    -   The null hypotheses that FDI *does not* Granger cause unemployment (Prob. 0.7666) are *not* rejected.\n    -   The null hypotheses that unemployment *does not* Granger cause GDP, inflation, or FDI are *not* rejected (Prob. 0.3018, 0.1480, 0.8123 respectively).\n-   **Why it is important:** This table provides direct evidence for the causal relationships (or lack thereof) between the key macroeconomic variables. It explicitly supports **Key Idea 1** (unidirectional causality to unemployment) and **Key Idea 4** (insignificant FDI influence on unemployment). These results are foundational for interpreting the impulse response functions and variance decomposition.\n\n-   **Table ID:** Table 4\n-   **Page:** 12\n-   **Title/Caption:** Variance decomposition analysis of unemployment\n-   **What it shows (content):** This table breaks down the percentage of the forecast error variance of the unemployment rate that is attributable to shocks from each variable (Unemployment itself, GDP_GROWTH, INFLATION, FDI) over 10 periods. In period 1, unemployment's variance is 100% due to its own shock. By period 2, Inflation accounts for 6.43% and GDP growth for 1.03%, while FDI accounts for 0.15%. Over 10 periods, inflation's contribution rises to 23.39%, GDP growth's to 5.4%, and FDI's to 1.63%. The remaining variance is explained by unemployment's own shock (69.58% in period 10).\n-   **Why it is important:** This table quantifies the relative importance of shocks from other variables in explaining fluctuations in unemployment over time. It complements the impulse response functions by providing a clearer picture of how much each variable contributes to the uncertainty of unemployment forecasts. It reinforces **Key Idea 3** (inflation as a significant driver of unemployment variance), **Key Idea 2** (GDP growth's contribution), and especially **Key Idea 4** (the very limited role of FDI in explaining unemployment variance).\n\n## 5. Important Images / Figures (with page numbers)\n\n-   **Figure ID:** Figure 1\n-   **Page:** 6\n-   **Title/Caption:** The evolution of unemployment rate in the CEE countries\n-   **What the figure shows:** This figure consists of 11 small line charts, each displaying the annual unemployment rate (%) for one of the CEE countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia) from 2000 to 2020. The Y-axis represents the unemployment rate, and the X-axis represents the years. Key visual patterns include a general increase in unemployment around 2008-2010 (global financial crisis), followed by a decline until 2019, and a slight uptick in 2020 (COVID-19). The magnitude of these changes varies significantly across countries, with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania showing dramatic peaks post-2008.\n-   **Why it is important:** This figure visually describes the historical context of unemployment in the CEE region, highlighting the impact of major economic events (like the 2008 crisis and COVID-19) and the diverse experiences of individual countries. It provides crucial background for understanding the motivation and scope of the study and supports **Key Idea 5**.\n\n-   **Figure ID:** Figure 2\n-   **Page:** 7\n-   **Title/Caption:** The evolution of GDP growth rate in the CEE countries\n-   **What the figure shows:** Similar to Figure 1, this figure presents 11 line charts, each illustrating the annual GDP growth rate (%) for the individual CEE countries from 2000 to 2020. The Y-axis represents GDP growth, and the X-axis represents the years. A prominent feature is the sharp drop in GDP growth rates, often into negative territory, around 2008-2009 due to the global financial crisis. This is followed by a period of recovery and fluctuation, with another significant dip observed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The charts show considerable variability in growth rates, with some countries experiencing more severe contractions than others.\n-   **Why it is important:** This figure is vital for establishing the economic context and trends in GDP growth for the CEE region, especially concerning crisis periods. It illustrates the economic environment in which unemployment evolves and is a key input variable in the Panel VAR model. It supports **Key Idea 5** by detailing the economic performance over the study period.\n\n-   **Figure ID:** Figure 3\n-   **Page:** 8\n-   **Title/Caption:** The evolution of consumer price index growth (inflation) in the CEE countries (reference year 2010=100)\n-   **What the figure shows:** This figure displays 11 line charts, each showing the annual inflation rate (consumer price index growth) for the CEE countries from 2000 to 2020. The Y-axis indicates the inflation rate. Many charts show higher and more volatile inflation rates in the early 2000s (especially Romania), with significant spikes around 2008-2009 (global crisis). Post-2009, inflation generally became more moderate and stable for most countries, though some variations and a slight increase in 2020 are visible.\n-   **Why it is important:** This figure provides the historical context of inflation, another critical macroeconomic variable in the study. It helps understand the economic environment and the fluctuations in prices that might influence unemployment. It supports **Key Idea 5** by showcasing the inflation trends across the CEE region.\n\n-   **Figure ID:** Figure 4\n-   **Page:** 9\n-   **Title/Caption:** The evolution FDI in the CEE countries\n-   **What the figure shows:** This figure presents 11 line charts illustrating the annual Foreign Direct Investment (% of GDP) for each CEE country from 2000 to 2020. The Y-axis indicates FDI as a percentage of GDP, and the X-axis shows the years. The charts reveal significant fluctuations in FDI inflows over time and across countries, with notable peaks in the mid-2000s (e.g., 2006-2007). There are also instances of negative FDI, indicating divestment. The figure highlights the variability and importance of FDI flows in these economies.\n-   **Why it is important:** This figure visualizes the trends of FDI, which is a key explanatory variable in the study. It helps to understand the patterns of foreign investment that were hypothesized to influence employment, despite the study's eventual finding of its statistically insignificant impact. It supports **Key Idea 5** and contextualizes **Key Idea 4**.\n\n-   **Figure ID:** Figure 5\n-   **Page:** 11\n-   **Title/Caption:** Impulse response functions\n-   **What the figure shows:** This figure contains three line charts, representing the impulse response functions of \"UNEMPLOYMENT\" to a one standard deviation shock in \"GDP_GROWTH\", \"INFLATION\", and \"FDI\", respectively, over 10 periods. The Y-axis shows the response of unemployment, and the X-axis shows the periods.\n    -   **Unemployment to GDP_GROWTH:** Shows unemployment decreasing for about 2 periods (negative response), then slightly increasing and stabilizing.\n    -   **Unemployment to INFLATION:** Shows unemployment increasing (positive response) for the entire period, peaking around period 3, then gradually decreasing but remaining positive.\n    -   **Unemployment to FDI:** Shows unemployment slightly decreasing for about 4 periods (negative response), but the confidence bands (dashed lines) indicate this effect is not statistically significant as they often cross zero. After period 4, it slightly increases and stabilizes.\n-   **Why it is important:** This figure is central to the empirical results of the paper. It directly illustrates the dynamic interactions and the direction and duration of the impact of shocks from GDP growth, inflation, and FDI on unemployment. It provides visual evidence supporting **Key Idea 2** (negative unemployment response to GDP growth), **Key Idea 3** (positive unemployment response to inflation), and critically, **Key Idea 4** (statistically insignificant FDI impact on unemployment).\n\n-   **Figure ID:** Figure 6\n-   **Page:** 13\n-   **Title/Caption:** Testing the stability of the VAR model - Unit circle\n-   **What the figure shows:** This figure is a scatter plot on a complex plane, showing the \"Inverse Roots of AR Characteristic Polynomial.\" The plot displays several points (roots) within a unit circle (a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin).\n-   **Why it is important:** This figure is crucial for validating the stability of the estimated VAR model. For a VAR model to be stable and correctly specified, all inverse roots of the characteristic polynomial must lie within the unit circle. The figure confirms this condition is met, thereby supporting the reliability and validity of the impulse response functions and variance decomposition derived from the model. This is a key methodological check.\n\n## 6. Concepts, Definitions, and Terminology\n\n-   **Term:** Panel VAR (PVAR)\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10\n    -   **Explanation:** A Vector Autoregression (VAR) model applied to panel data (data collected over time for multiple cross-sectional units). It's a generalization of simultaneous equations that estimates the interconnections between variables over time, allowing for endogenous interactions and country-specific effects.\n    -   **Role in the document:** It is the central methodological approach used to analyze the dynamic relationships between the macroeconomic variables.\n\n-   **Term:** Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 5, 11, 12\n    -   **Explanation:** A tool used in VAR models to describe the response of an endogenous variable over time to a one-standard-deviation shock in another variable in the system, while holding all other variables constant.\n    -   **Role in the document:** Used to describe the dynamic effects of shocks in GDP growth, inflation, and FDI on the unemployment rate.\n\n-   **Term:** Variance Decomposition Analysis\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 5, 12\n    -   **Explanation:** A technique used in VAR models to assess the importance of changes (shocks) in one variable in explaining the forecast error variance of changes in other variables over time.\n    -   **Role in the document:** Used to quantify how much of the unemployment rate's fluctuation is explained by shocks from GDP growth, inflation, and FDI.\n\n-   **Term:** Stationarity\n    -   **Page(s):** 5, 10\n    -   **Explanation:** A property of a time series where its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) do not change over time. Non-stationary series can lead to spurious regression results.\n    -   **Role in the document:** It is a critical precondition for applying Panel VAR. The study performs unit root tests to ensure all variables are stationary in levels before proceeding with the VAR estimation.\n\n-   **Term:** Granger Causality\n    -   **Page(s):** 9, 11, 14\n    -   **Explanation:** A statistical hypothesis test that determines if one time series is useful in forecasting another. If past values of variable X help predict future values of variable Y, then X Granger-causes Y.\n    -   **Role in the document:** Used to determine the causal direction of relationships between GDP growth, FDI, inflation, and the unemployment rate.\n\n-   **Term:** CEE Countries (Central and Eastern European countries)\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13\n    -   **Explanation:** A group of 11 specific European Union member countries (Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Slovakia) that underwent a transition from centralized to market economies after the 1990s.\n    -   **Role in the document:** This is the specific geographical and economic region that is the focus of the entire study.\n\n-   **Term:** FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14\n    -   **Explanation:** Investment made by a firm or individual in one country into business interests located in another country, often expressed as a percentage of GDP in this study. It is considered an important driver of economic stimulus, technology transfer, and job creation.\n    -   **Role in the document:** It is one of the key macroeconomic variables whose impact on unemployment is being analyzed.\n\n-   **Term:** Unemployment rate\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n    -   **Explanation:** The percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment and willing to work.\n    -   **Role in the document:** It is the primary dependent variable or the main focus of the analysis regarding how other macroeconomic factors affect it.\n\n-   **Term:** GDP growth rate\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n    -   **Explanation:** The annual percentage change in a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), indicating economic expansion or contraction. Measured in constant 2010 prices in this study.\n    -   **Role in the document:** It is a key independent variable whose impact on unemployment and interaction with other variables is being analyzed.\n\n-   **Term:** CPI growth rate (Inflation)\n    -   **Page(s):** 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n    -   **Explanation:** The annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Measured in constant 2010 prices in this study.\n    -   **Role in the document:** It is another key independent variable whose impact on unemployment and interaction with other variables is being analyzed.\n\n## 7. Constraints, Limitations, and Open Questions\n\n-   **Stated Limitations:**\n    -   **Statistically Insignificant FDI Impact (Page 11, Section 4.2.3; Page 12, Section 4.2.4; Page 14, Section 5. Conclusions):** The document explicitly states that the decrease in unemployment due to an FDI shock is \"statistically insignificant\" and that FDI \"does not have a statistically significant impact on unemployment.\" This is a key finding but also a limitation in terms of identifying a strong policy lever through FDI for unemployment.\n-   **Assumptions or Conditions:**\n    -   **Stationarity of variables (Page 10, Section 4.2.1):** The validity of the Panel VAR model relies on the assumption that all variables are stationary in levels, which was tested and confirmed using LLC and IPS tests.\n    -   **Optimal Lag Length (Page 10, Section 4.2.1):** The choice of VAR(3) model based on Hannan-Quinn criterion is an assumption of the model specification, acknowledging that other criteria suggested different lag lengths.\n    -   **Model Stability (Page 12-13, Section 4.2.6):** The results are conditional on the estimated model being stable (inverse roots within the unit circle) and errors being independent (LM test).\n    -   **Cholesky Decomposition (Page 5, Section 3):** The ordering of variables in the Cholesky decomposition for impulse response functions can sometimes influence the results, though the document doesn't explicitly discuss this as a limitation, it is an implicit methodological assumption.\n-   **Open Problems or Future Work:**\n    -   The document does not explicitly state \"future work\" or \"open problems.\" However, given the statistically insignificant impact of FDI on unemployment, future research could explore conditional effects of FDI (e.g., interacting with institutional quality, specific sectors, or types of FDI) or using alternative methodologies that might uncover more nuanced relationships.\n\n## 8. Notes for the Storytelling / Presentation Agent\n\n-   **Which Key Ideas should be emphasized for:**\n    -   **A technical audience:** Emphasize **Key Idea 1** (unidirectional causality) with specific Chi-sq and Prob. values from Table 3. Detail **Key Idea 2** and **Key Idea 3** with quantitative responses and timings (e.g., \"maximum decrease of 0.2% in 2 years\" for GDP shock, \"0.8% increase after 3 years\" for inflation shock) referencing Figure 5 and Table 4. Stress **Key Idea 4** with the robust evidence of insignificance from both Granger causality (Table 3) and variance decomposition (Table 4, 1.63% after 10 years). Also, highlight the methodological rigor (stationarity tests, lag selection, model stability from Figures 6, Tables 1 & 2).\n    -   **A non-technical audience:** Focus on the practical implications of **Key Idea 2** (economic growth helps reduce unemployment) and **Key Idea 3** (inflation worsens unemployment). Keep the explanation of **Key Idea 4** simple: FDI doesn't seem to be a direct lever for reducing unemployment in CEE countries. Use **Key Idea 5** to set the scene: the unique challenges and transitions of CEE economies. Simplify the technical details of the Panel VAR and stability tests, perhaps just stating that the model is robust.\n\n-   **Which tables and figures are the BEST candidates to embed in a story or slide deck:**\n    -   **Figures 1-4 (Pages 6-9):** Excellent for setting the scene and providing context. Use them to illustrate the economic journey of CEE countries (crisis, recovery, COVID-19 impact) for unemployment, GDP, inflation, and FDI trends.\n    -   **Figure 5 (Page 11):** Absolutely essential. This directly shows the main results of the impulse response functions. It visually communicates the core findings about how unemployment reacts to shocks in GDP, inflation, and FDI. It can be used to explain **Key Idea 2, 3, and 4**.\n    -   **Table 3 (Page 11):** Good for visually showing the \"Prob.\" values for Granger causality, which is very clear evidence for **Key Idea 1** and **Key Idea 4**. For a non-technical audience, this could be simplified into bullet points rather than showing the full table.\n    -   **Table 4 (Page 12):** Useful for a deeper dive, especially for a technical audience, to quantify the contribution of each shock to unemployment variance. It reinforces **Key Idea 2, 3, and 4**.\n\n-   **Any natural narrative arcs:**\n    -   **Problem & Context:** CEE countries' transition and crisis impact on macro variables (Section 1 & 4.1, Figures 1-4).\n    -   **Literature Gap/Contribution:** How previous research is mixed, justifying a new Panel VAR approach (Section 2 & 1).\n    -   **Methodology:** Explaining the Panel VAR and its steps (Section 3 & 4.2).\n    -   **Key Findings:** Presenting the causality, impulse responses, and variance decomposition for unemployment (Section 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, Table 3, 4, Figure 5).\n    -   **Conclusions & Implications:** Summarizing what was learned and its policy relevance (Section 5).\n\n-   **Any sections that can probably be downplayed or skipped in a high-level story:**\n    -   For a very high-level non-technical story, the detailed discussion of unit root tests (Table 1) and lag length criteria (Table 2) could be summarized as \"The model was rigorously tested and found to be robust and stable\" without showing the tables themselves.\n    -   The specific country-by-country details within Section 4.1. Dataset Description, especially if the focus is on regional trends, could be condensed into aggregate observations or a few striking examples.",

The Y-axis represents the unemployment rate, and the X-axis represents the years. Key visual patterns include a general increase in unemployment around 2008-2010 (global financial crisis), followed by a decline until 2019, and a slight uptick in 2020 (COVID-19). The magnitude of these changes varies significantly across countries, with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania showing dramatic peaks post-2008. This figure visually describes the historical context of unemployment in the CEE region, highlighting the impact of major economic events (like the 2008 crisis and COVID-19) and the diverse experiences of individual countries.
