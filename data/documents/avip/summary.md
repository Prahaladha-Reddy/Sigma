## 1. Document Overview

- **Document type**: Policy report / Technical report.
- **Main purpose or goal of the document**: To explore the likely impacts of autonomous (self-driving, driverless, robotic) vehicles on future travel and transportation planning, predict their development and deployment timelines, critically evaluate their benefits and costs, and discuss policy implications for maximizing benefits and minimizing problems.
- **Approximate scope**:
  - Number of pages: 49 (excluding cover, including references).
  - High-level topics covered: Autonomous vehicle (AV) definitions and operational models, benefits and costs (including internal and external impacts, social equity), travel impacts (increase/decrease in vehicle travel), development and deployment predictions (S-curve, historical precedents, market penetration timelines), planning objectives and implications (roadway design, pricing, parking, transit), potential conflicts, and solutions.
- **One paragraph high-level summary**: This report from the Victoria Transport Policy Institute provides a grounded analysis of autonomous vehicle implementation, contrasting optimistic industry predictions with a more skeptical view based on historical technology adoption and complex real-world challenges. It forecasts that Level 5 AVs will become commercially available in the late 2020s but will be expensive and limited initially, with significant impacts on travel, congestion, and social equity only becoming widespread in the 2040s-2060s. The document emphasizes that AVs are not a guaranteed "game changer" and their net benefits will largely depend on public policies, efficient pricing, and whether they facilitate shared mobility rather than increased private vehicle use and sprawl.

## 2. Detailed Section-by-Section Summary

- **Executive Summary** (Pages 3-6)
  - Summarizes the report's core findings regarding AVs. It notes that while optimists predict rapid displacement of human driving by 2030, the report offers skepticism due to significant obstacles (technical, regulatory, cost, and consumer demand) and potential overestimates of benefits.
  - Highlights that AVs will likely be more expensive than human-driven private vehicles and public transit but cheaper than ride-hailing/taxis. Shared AVs will be cheaper but less convenient than private AVs.
  - Introduces a table (Exhibit ES-2, Page 4) outlining potential benefits (reduced stress, mobility for non-drivers, increased safety, reduced parking costs) and costs/problems (increased vehicle/infrastructure costs, user risks, privacy concerns, increased traffic problems, social equity issues).
  - Emphasizes that vehicle technology penetration is slow, taking decades to dominate markets. Level 5 autonomy is predicted for late 2020s commercial availability, but widespread affordability and significant impact (e.g., congestion reduction, mobility for moderate-income non-drivers) are projected for 2040s-2060s. Some benefits may require dedicated AV lanes, raising equity concerns.
  - Discusses the uncertainty of AVs increasing or decreasing total vehicle travel, depending on policies. Current policies might increase travel and sprawl by 10-30%, while efficient pricing and roadway management favoring shared vehicles could reduce problems.
  - Stresses that many benefits (like congestion reduction) require AVs to operate autonomously in dedicated lanes.
  - Concludes that AVs are one of many trends, not necessarily a "game changer" for most of our lives, and their impact depends on shifts towards shared vehicles and multi-modal communities. Transportation professionals have a crucial role in planning and regulation.

- **Introduction** (Page 7)
  - States the report's purpose: to predict how AVs will affect future travel demands, infrastructure needs (roads, parking, transit), and to identify public policies to minimize risks and maximize benefits.
  - Acknowledges uncertainty, with optimists (often those with financial interests) predicting rapid, huge benefits based on experiences with digital technologies, while the report maintains skepticism due to significant technical, regulatory, and cost obstacles unique to motor vehicles.
  - Notes that motor vehicles are costly, durable, and highly regulated, making technology penetration slow. AVs introduce new safety problems (e.g., system failures being fatal) that differ from typical computer errors.
  - Highlights policy implications: AVs rely on public infrastructure and impose external costs, requiring planning and regulation. Policymakers must decide on dedicated AV lanes, pricing, and programming to balance user and community benefits.

- **Autonomous Vehicle Operational Models** (Page 8)
  - Defines the six levels of driving automation (SAE J3016) in Exhibit 1, emphasizing that many predicted benefits require Level 5 autonomy (operating without a driver in all normal conditions).
  - Presents Exhibit 2, comparing four vehicle operating models: Private Human-Driven, Private Autonomous, Shared Autonomous Vehicles (taxis), and Shared Autonomous Rides (micro-transit), detailing their advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate users.

- **Benefits and Costs** (Pages 9-19)
  - **Reduced Driver Stress, Improved Productivity and Mobility** (Page 9)
    - AVs can reduce stress, allow work/rest while traveling, lowering travel time unit costs. However, vehicle interiors may become cluttered and dirty.
    - Self-driving vehicles can introduce new stresses like "access anxiety" if unable to reach destinations due to weather or unmapped roads.
    - Self-driving taxis offer cheaper service than human-driven ones but lower quality (no driver assistance, security, cleaning issues). Shared rides are cheapest but least convenient.
    - AVs provide independent mobility for non-drivers, increasing productivity and reducing chauffeuring burdens. Potential for communities to reduce support for public transit if overly optimistic about AVs. Dedicated AV lanes might reduce human-operated traffic capacity.

  - **Ownership and Operating Costs** (Pages 10-12)
    - AVs require robust, redundant components, increasing maintenance costs. Optional AV features already cost thousands, and subscriptions add hundreds annually. Tesla's FSD costs $15,000.
    - Repair costs for minor collisions are increased by advanced sensor systems (AAA 2018).
    - Optimists' low operating cost estimates (e.g., <5¢/mile) are deemed underestimates, as they often ignore battery replacement, efficient road user fees, cleaning, vandalism, profits, and insurance. The report estimates electric AV operating costs at 10-25¢/mile, similar to fossil fuel vehicles.
    - Experiences with previous vehicle innovations (automatic transmissions, airbags) suggest AV capability will initially be high-priced and take decades to become standard.
    - Estimates private AV costs at $0.80-$1.20/mile initially, declining to $0.60-$1.00/mile. Shared AVs $0.50-$1.00/mile, shared autonomous rides $0.20-0.40/passenger-mile (cheaper than taxis, more expensive than personal vehicles or public transit).
    - Public policies (e.g., road user fees) can affect these costs and make shared vehicles more attractive.

  - **Traffic Safety and Public Health** (Pages 13-14)
    - Optimists' claims of 90% crash reduction are questioned, as AVs introduce new risks: hardware/software failures, malicious hacking, increased risk-taking (offsetting behavior, over-trusting), platooning risks, increased total vehicle travel (due to convenience), and difficulties detecting non-auto travelers (pedestrians, cyclists).
    - Tesla's self-driving software has high failure rates, not ready for broad implementation.
    - Shared AVs could reduce crashes by providing alternatives for high-risk drivers.
    - Discusses the "Autonomous Vehicle Trolley Problem" – the ethical dilemma of programming AVs to prioritize certain lives in unavoidable crash scenarios, raising public policy issues about who decides these trade-offs.
    - Sohrabi, Khreis, and Lord (2020) identified 32 pathways for AVs affecting public health (17 negative, 8 positive), recommending TDM policies to favor shared, electric AVs and prevent increased VMT.

  - **External Cost** (Page 15)
    - Optimists claim AVs reduce external costs (congestion, parking, crashes, pollution), but the report states these impacts are uncertain and could increase external costs (e.g., if AVs maximize comfort/safety, reducing traffic speeds; if they increase total vehicle travel and sprawl).
    - Many benefits (congestion, pollution reduction) require costly dedicated lanes for platooning, which are only feasible on some highways. Shared AVs need docking/loading stations.
    - Even electric AVs don't eliminate pollution entirely (due to fossil-fuel electricity generation and non-exhaust particulate emissions from brakes/tires).
    - Overall impacts depend on design and regulation: cautious programming reduces speed/causes delays, while speed-maximizing programming increases risks and encourages shortcuts.

  - **Social Equity Impacts** (Pages 16-17)
    - Discusses horizontal equity (subsidies, road space) and vertical equity (abilities/needs, income/affordability).
    - **Subsidies**: Without new cost-recovery pricing, electric AVs may receive inequitable subsidies (no fuel taxes, dedicated lanes).
    - **External Traffic Costs**: AVs' impact on congestion, pedestrian delay, crash risk, pollution is uncertain and depends on policies and induced travel. Dedicated lanes could increase throughput but mix impacts under most circumstances.
    - **Road Space**: Road space is scarce; equity requires prioritizing space-efficient modes (buses, vanpools). Private AVs likely have low occupancy and might "circle the block" to avoid parking fees, worsening congestion. Roads should be managed to favor shared modes.
    - **Abilities and Needs**: AVs can provide independent mobility for people with disabilities or non-drivers, and autonomous taxis could be affordable options.
    - **Income – Affordability**: AVs will be costly for decades ($10,000/vehicle-year increment), making private AVs unaffordable for lower-income households. Policies favoring private AVs (e.g., dedicated lanes) would be regressive. Shared taxis could increase affordability for low-mileage users.
    - Summary: AVs support some equity goals but contradict others; private AVs are costly, subsidies for them are unfair. Net impact depends on policies preventing induced travel, sprawl, and automobile dependency.

  - **Benefit and Cost Summary** (Pages 18-19)
    - Exhibit 8 (Page 18) compares financial costs, convenience, comfort, external costs, social equity impacts, and appropriate uses for Private Human-driven, Private Autonomous, Shared Autonomous Vehicles, and Shared Autonomous Rides.
    - Reiterates that impacts depend on specific vehicle features, with financial costs being high initially for AVs and declining over time.
    - Exhibit 9 (Page 19) provides a consolidated table of internal (user) and external (others) benefits and costs, emphasizing that total impacts depend on how AVs affect total vehicle travel. Most benefits require Level 5 automation, which allows vehicles to transport non-drivers and drive empty.

- **Travel Impacts** (Pages 20-24)
  - Key factor is how AVs affect total vehicle travel (VMT).
  - **Increases VMT**: Non-drivers' travel, empty vehicle travel (drop-off/pickup, maintenance), reduced operating costs, increased convenience/productivity, encouragement of sprawl. Studies predict 10-30% VMT increase.
  - **Reduces VMT**: More convenient shared vehicle services, self-driving buses/improved last-mile access, reduced traffic risk/parking needs making urban living attractive.
  - The net impact depends on households' choice between urban/suburban living and private ownership vs. sharing.
  - Many travelers prefer owning vehicles for convenience (keeping items), speed/reliability, lower costs for high-mileage drivers, and status. Shared rides have lower costs but less convenience/comfort.
  - Exhibit 12 (Page 22) shows a "Generalized Cost (Money and Time) Travel Demand Curve," illustrating that as costs decline, vehicle travel increases. Private AV owners are likely to travel more due to lower operating and increased convenience costs, while shared AV users might travel less due to higher financial costs and reduced convenience compared to personal vehicles.
  - Surveys show more predictions of increased VMT than declines.
  - Exhibit 13 (Page 23) details AV impacts on various travel demands: freight trucks, small commercial, public transport, longer-distance personal trips, local suburban/rural, local urban, and non-drivers.
  - Scenarios for Jake (affluent/visually impaired), Bonnie (multi-modal), Melisa & Johnny (suburban family), and Garry (high-risk driver) illustrate diverse impacts on vehicle ownership and travel, often leading to increased VMT.
  - Exhibit 14 (Page 24) summarizes these scenarios, showing that most lead to increased vehicle travel and external costs, especially with current policies. Efficient road pricing and HOV lanes could make shared rides more attractive, reducing VMT.
  - Additional VMT provides marginal benefits; much of it is economically inefficient due to external costs.

- **Development and Deployment Predictions** (Pages 25-31)
  - New technologies typically follow an S-curve development pattern (Exhibit 15, Page 25): concept, development, testing, approval, commercial release, product improvement, market expansion, maturation, saturation, decline.
  - Past optimistic predictions for AVs (e.g., Urmson's 2019 prediction) were overly ambitious.
  - AVs are currently in development/testing (TRL 6 out of 10). They require more complex computer systems than aircraft (Exhibit 16, Page 25) due to diverse roadway interactions, leading to challenges and errors.
  - Current Level 4 AVs have limited operability (80-90% of desired destinations) and struggle in heavy rain/snow, unmapped roads, or novel situations. Years of testing and regulatory approval are needed for widespread commercial availability.
  - Historical examples (Exhibit 17, Page 28, and Exhibit 18, Page 29) show that vehicle technologies (automatic transmissions, airbags, hybrids, navigation systems, electric vehicles) take decades (25-100+ years) from initial commercial availability to market saturation.
  - AVs are more complex and costly, so market acceptance and penetration will likely take longer. Fleet turnover is slow (3-5 decades for 90% penetration).
  - **Deployment Predictions**: Based on this analysis, the report predicts (Exhibit 19, Page 30, and Exhibit 20, Page 30/28) that Level 5 AVs will be commercially available in the late 2020s, but only a minority of new vehicles will be fully autonomous initially. Half of new vehicle sales are autonomous by 2045, and half of the fleet by 2060. Faster deployment would require significant premature scrapping of functional vehicles.
  - Commercial vehicles (trucks, buses, taxis) are likely to automate first due to high labor costs and predictable routes, though some human operators may still be needed.
  - Factors affecting deployment speed: technological development (Level 5 reliability), testing/regulatory approval, incremental costs (initially high), consumer preferences (safety, privacy, ownership vs. sharing), service quality/affordability, and public policies (encouraging AV development, road pricing, HOV lanes, infill development, mandates).

- **Planning Objectives** (Pages 32)
  - Exhibit 21 (Page 32) describes how AVs impact ten community objectives: congestion reduction, roadway cost savings, parking cost savings, consumer savings/affordability, traffic safety, improved mobility options, energy conservation, pollution reduction, physical fitness/health, and strategic development (sprawl). Many impacts are contradictory.
  - Exhibit 22 (Page 32) compares benefits for costly personal AVs, inexpensive personal AVs, shared AVs, and shared AVs with TDM incentives, showing that shared AVs with TDM incentives align best with community objectives.

- **Planning Implications** (Pages 33-37)
  - **Roadway Design**: AVs may require new features (lane markings, electronic signs, wireless access). Platooning benefits require dedicated lanes, which are only feasible on some highways. HOV priority lanes may be needed to encourage higher-occupancy AV travel.
  - **Transportation Pricing**: Electric AVs currently increase VMT and traffic problems (10-30% increase) and pay no road user fees. Governments need new fees (4-8¢/vehicle-mile, plus 5-30¢/mile decongestion pricing in congested conditions).
  - **Curb Management**: Cities need to manage curbs for convenient passenger loading/unloading for shared AVs, providing loading areas or increasing parking turnover.
  - **Parking Planning**: AVs affect parking demand in various ways. Optimists predict significant reductions. Shift to shared vehicles reduces ownership and parking needs. Private AVs might "circle the block," increasing traffic. Travelers will likely want vehicles within minutes, reducing but not eliminating urban parking demand.
  - **Public Transit Needs**: AVs can reduce transit operating costs, allowing more frequent service with smaller vehicles or flexible routes (paratransit). Cheaper taxi services can provide convenient mobility, especially in suburban/rural areas. However, AVs could reduce conventional transit demand, revenue, and political support. High capacity transit is still needed on major corridors. Efficient road pricing, HOV lanes, and transit improvements are recommended.
  - **Other Trends Affecting Travel Demands** (Page 34): AVs are one of many trends (demographics, user preferences, price changes, ITS, improved travel options, planning innovations). Their ultimate impact depends on interaction with these trends.
  - **Benefits by Autonomous Vehicle Type** (Exhibit 24, Page 35): A matrix showing that many benefits (mobility for non-drivers, user savings, external benefits) require Level 5 and shared vehicles, or dedicated AV lanes.
  - **Autonomous Vehicle Planning Issues Timeline** (Exhibit 25, Page 35): A timeline (2020s-2080s) of issues from reliability/safety to AV mandates, outlining analysis required and policies needed.
  - **Optimistic and Pessimistic Outcomes** (Exhibit 26, Page 36): Compares outcomes across issues like sharing, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, public transport, intermodal management, data management, parking, curb access, land use, and transport planning. Optimistic outcomes typically involve policies that encourage sharing, equity, and multi-modal integration. Pessimistic outcomes involve private luxury goods, favoring occupants over other road users, and increased sprawl.
  - **Autonomous Taxi Service Impacts** (Page 37): Early testing of driverless taxis (Waymo, Uber) showed challenges (pedestrian death, slow operation, limited conditions). Commercial availability requires profitability, consumer confidence, and cost reductions, likely taking years. Taxis primarily serve local urban trips. Significant VMT reduction requires inexpensive, ubiquitous shared AVs integrated with other modes, supported by policies discouraging private ownership.

- **Potential Conflicts and Solutions** (Page 38)
  - Conflicts exist between user (comfort, safety) and community goals (traffic speeds, crash risk for other road users). Dedicated AV lanes raise fairness and pricing concerns.
  - Planning conflicts: AVs could exacerbate congestion, sprawl, and inequity by increasing total vehicle travel and displacing public transit.
  - Mentions "Shared Mobility Principles for Livable Cities" (www.sharedmobilityprinciples.org) as guidelines for optimizing AV benefits (e.g., plan cities/mobility together, prioritize people, support shared/efficient use, promote equity, transition to clean energy, fair user fees, public benefits, integration, shared fleets in dense urban areas).
  - Strategies to maximize AV benefits and minimize social costs include emphasizing social goals, testing/regulating for safety/efficiency, responsible data management, programming AVs based on ethical/community goals, efficient pricing/vehicle priority, affordable shared services, multimodal integration, universal design, street redesign, reduced parking minimums, and efficient development pricing.

- **Conclusions** (Pages 39-41)
  - Reaffirms skepticism towards overly optimistic AV predictions, highlighting significant obstacles (reliability, affordability, performance, new risks, regulatory approval, slow market penetration, driver resistance).
  - Level 5 AVs optimistically available by 2025-2030, but expensive and limited initially. Widespread affordability for middle/lower-income households is projected for the 2050s.
  - Shared AVs (taxis, micro-transit) available by 2030s, cheaper than human-driven taxis but with lower service quality. Unlikely to dominate suburban/rural travel.
  - Most vehicles autonomous by 2045, fleet by 2060. Faster deployment requires premature scrapping.
  - Social equity impacts are mixed. Benefits occur if AVs are affordable and common; congestion/emission reductions require dedicated lanes and policies favoring shared travel.
  - Most AVs assumed electric, but battery costs and lack of fuel taxes mean similar operating costs to fossil fuel vehicles with efficient road user fees. Self-driving buses/trucks may automate quickly.
  - Reinforces that AVs may increase or reduce total vehicle travel, depending on policies. With current policies, VMT and sprawl likely increase 10-30%, which is economically inefficient. TDM incentives and shared vehicle lanes can reduce VMT and problems.
  - Many benefits require AVs to operate autonomously in dedicated lanes. AVs are one of many trends and only a "paradigm shift" if they lead to large shifts to shared vehicles and multi-modal communities.
  - Transportation professionals are crucial in planning, defining standards, evaluating benefits/costs, and developing policies to support community goals.

## 3. Key Ideas, Claims, and Takeaways

-   **Key Idea 1 – Skepticism Towards Optimistic AV Timelines and Benefits**
    -   **What the idea/claim is**: The report argues against overly optimistic predictions (often from industry players) that autonomous vehicles will be ubiquitous, affordable, and transformative by 2030. It suggests that these predictions overlook significant technical, regulatory, cost, and social obstacles.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document**: This is a central premise, setting the tone for the report's more conservative and realistic forecasts. It informs the entire analysis of deployment timelines, benefits, costs, and policy implications.
    -   **Where it appears**: Executive Summary (Page 3), Introduction (Page 7), Development and Deployment Predictions (Page 25), Conclusions (Page 39).
    -   **Evidence**: The document references historical adoption rates of previous vehicle technologies (Exhibit 17, Page 28; Exhibit 18, Page 29), notes the complexity of AV software compared to aircraft (Exhibit 16, Page 25), current AV operational failures (Page 14, 26), and the slow pace of regulatory approval and market penetration for other automotive innovations.

-   **Key Idea 2 – Costs and Affordability are Significant Barriers to Rapid AV Adoption**
    -   **What the idea/claim is**: Autonomous vehicles, especially Level 5, will be significantly more expensive to purchase, operate, and maintain than human-driven vehicles. These high costs, including additional equipment, software subscriptions, insurance, and battery replacement (for EVs), will limit their initial market penetration and affordability, particularly for lower-income households.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document**: Cost is a primary driver of market adoption. If AVs are not affordable, their widespread use and the realization of many predicted benefits will be delayed. This impacts social equity, travel patterns, and public transit needs.
    -   **Where it appears**: Executive Summary (Page 3), Benefits and Costs (Pages 10-12, 18), Social Equity Impacts (Page 17), Conclusions (Page 39).
    -   **Evidence**: Exhibit ES-1 (Page 3) and Exhibit 5 (Page 12) illustrate AVs costing more than human-driven private vehicles. The text details additional costs for sensors, software, maintenance, and estimates electric AV operating costs (10-25¢/mile) higher than optimistic forecasts, incorporating battery replacement and road user fees.

-   **Key Idea 3 – Autonomous Vehicles Will Not Inherently Reduce Traffic Problems; Policy is Key**
    -   **What the idea/claim is**: Contrary to common optimistic views, AVs are not guaranteed to reduce congestion, pollution, or crashes. In fact, without careful policy interventions, they are likely to increase total vehicle travel (VMT) due to non-driver mobility, empty vehicle travel, reduced operating costs, and encouragement of sprawl, thereby exacerbating traffic problems.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document**: This challenges a fundamental assumption about AVs and shifts the focus from technological determinism to the critical role of governance. It underscores that the ultimate impacts of AVs depend on how they are designed, programmed, and regulated.
    -   **Where it appears**: Executive Summary (Page 4, 6), External Cost (Page 15), Travel Impacts (Pages 20-24), Planning Objectives (Page 32), Planning Implications (Page 33), Potential Conflicts and Solutions (Page 38), Conclusions (Page 41).
    -   **Evidence**: Exhibit ES-2 (Page 4) and Exhibit 9 (Page 19) list "Increased traffic problems" as a cost. Exhibit 10 (Page 20) and Exhibit 13 (Page 23) detail factors increasing VMT. Exhibit 12 (Page 22) shows increased travel as costs decline. The report explicitly states that current policies would likely increase VMT by 10-30% and that many benefits require dedicated lanes and effective demand management.

-   **Key Idea 4 – Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) Offer Greater Societal Benefits Than Private AVs**
    -   **What the idea/claim is**: The report consistently argues that shared autonomous vehicles and rides (like self-driving taxis or micro-transit) are more aligned with community goals, social equity, and congestion reduction than privately owned autonomous vehicles. They offer lower costs, reduce vehicle ownership, parking demand, and can be integrated into multi-modal transport systems.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document**: This provides a clear policy direction for maximizing the positive impacts of AV technology. It identifies the operational model that can best achieve strategic community objectives like sustainability and affordability.
    -   **Where it appears**: Executive Summary (Page 3, 5), Operating Models Compared (Exhibit 2, Page 8), Benefit and Cost Summary (Exhibit 8, Page 18), Travel Impacts (Page 20), Most Suitable Travelers and Trips (Exhibit 11, Page 21), Planning Objectives (Exhibit 22, Page 32), Potential Conflicts and Solutions (Page 38), Conclusions (Page 40).
    -   **Evidence**: Exhibit 2 (Page 8) and Exhibit 8 (Page 18) show SAVs having lower fixed costs and greater equity. Exhibit 11 (Page 21) identifies SAVs as suitable for urban residents and cost-conscious travelers. Exhibit 22 (Page 32) explicitly compares benefits, showing "Shared AVs with TDM Incentives" achieve most planning objectives.

-   **Key Idea 5 – Widespread Significant Impacts of AVs Are Decades Away (2040s-2060s)**
    -   **What the idea/claim is**: Based on historical technology adoption patterns and the unique complexities of AVs, the report predicts that while Level 5 AVs may be commercially available in the late 2020s, it will take until at least 2045 for half of new vehicles to be autonomous, and 2060 for half of the total vehicle fleet to be autonomous. Consequently, most significant societal benefits and problems will not manifest until the 2040s to 2060s.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document**: This provides a realistic timeline for policymakers and planners, suggesting that immediate, drastic changes based on AVs are not warranted. It allows for a more measured approach to planning and regulation, focusing on incremental development rather than a sudden "paradigm shift."
    -   **Where it appears**: Executive Summary (Page 3, 5), Development and Deployment Predictions (Pages 29-30), Autonomous Vehicle Planning Requirement Time-Line (Exhibit 27, Page 37), Conclusions (Page 39, 40).
    -   **Evidence**: Exhibit ES-2 (Page 5), Exhibit 19 (Page 30), and Exhibit 20 (Page 30) explicitly chart sales, fleet, and travel penetration over time, with significant penetration occurring well after 2040. The section on "Experience with Previous Vehicle Technology Deployment" (Pages 28-29) provides historical data for comparison.

## 4. Important Tables (with page numbers)

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit ES-1
-   **Page**: 3
-   **Title/Caption**: Cost Comparison
-   **What it shows (content)**: This bar chart compares the cost per mile (in dollars) for various transportation modes and vehicle types, differentiating between Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Human Driven (HD) options. The categories include: HD car variable costs, Shared AV, Public transit, AV variable costs, HD car average costs, AV Taxi, AV average costs, Ride-hailing, and HO Taxi. It shows that HD car variable costs and AV variable costs are the lowest, followed by public transit. Shared AVs and AV taxis are in the middle, while Ride-hailing and HO Taxis are the most expensive per mile.
-   **Why it is important**: This table provides a quick, visual summary of the economic argument that AVs are not necessarily cheaper than private human-driven vehicles or public transit, but they can be cheaper than traditional ride-hailing and taxis. It directly supports **Key Idea 2** about the cost barriers and **Key Idea 4** about the relative affordability of shared AVs compared to human-driven for-hire services. It also helps contextualize the potential shift in travel behavior based on cost.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit ES-2 (also similar to Exhibit 20 on page 30 and Exhibit 28 on page 40)
-   **Page**: 5
-   **Title/Caption**: Autonomous Vehicle Sales, Fleet, Travel and Benefit Projections
-   **What it shows (content)**: This line chart projects the market penetration of autonomous vehicles over time (2030-2080) for sales, fleet, and total travel, with higher and lower estimates for each. It also overlays lines indicating when different benefits (less driver stress/mobility for affluent non-drivers, cheaper taxi services, cheaper truck/bus services, increased safety, reduced congestion/emissions, less driver stress/mobility for middle/low-income non-drivers) are expected to become significant. The chart indicates that sales penetration precedes fleet and travel penetration, with higher rates generally taking until 2045-2060 to reach 50% or more. Benefits for affluent users appear earlier, while widespread benefits like congestion reduction or mobility for lower-income groups emerge much later.
-   **Why it is important**: This is a crucial visual for **Key Idea 5**, illustrating the report's central argument about the slow, decades-long deployment timeline for AVs and the phased realization of their benefits. It visually represents the S-curve adoption model and differentiates when various social and economic impacts are likely to occur, directly supporting the skeptical view of rapid, universal transformation.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 1
-   **Page**: 8
-   **Title/Caption**: Automated Driving Levels (SAE J3016)
-   **What it shows (content)**: This table defines the six levels of driving automation (Level 0 to Level 5) as established by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE J3016). For each level, it describes what the human in the driver's seat must do and what the automated driving features do. Level 0 offers warnings/momentary assistance, Level 1 provides steering *or* brake/acceleration support, Level 2 provides steering *and* brake/acceleration support. Levels 3-5 are automated driving features where the vehicle drives itself under certain conditions. Level 3 requires human intervention when requested. Level 4 drives itself under limited conditions without human intervention, and Level 5 drives everywhere in all conditions without human intervention.
-   **Why it is important**: This table is foundational for understanding the technology discussed throughout the report. It clarifies the technical definitions of "autonomous vehicles" and highlights that many predicted benefits (especially transporting non-drivers or goods) only apply to Level 5. This definition is critical for the report's argument that achieving Level 5 is extremely challenging and will take a long time, thus supporting **Key Idea 1** and **Key Idea 5**.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 2
-   **Page**: 8
-   **Title/Caption**: Operating Models Compared
-   **What it shows (content)**: This table compares four vehicle operating models: Private Human-Driven Vehicles, Private Autonomous Vehicles, Shared Autonomous Vehicles, and Shared Autonomous Rides. For each model, it lists advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate users. For example, Private HDVs have low costs and are always available, while Shared Autonomous Rides have the lowest total costs and minimize congestion but offer the least convenience.
-   **Why it is important**: This table is critical for understanding the different ways AVs can be deployed and their implications. It directly supports **Key Idea 4** by detailing why shared models (Shared Autonomous Vehicles and Rides) offer greater societal benefits (lowest costs, minimized congestion/risk/pollution) compared to private AVs (high costs, likely increase travel). This comparison is central to the policy recommendations later in the report.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 10
-   **Page**: 20
-   **Title/Caption**: Potential Travel Impacts (Miller and Kang 2019; Rodier 2018)
-   **What it shows (content)**: This table is divided into two columns: "Increases Vehicle Travel" and "Reduces Vehicle Travel." It lists specific mechanisms through which autonomous vehicles could impact total vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Factors increasing VMT include increased non-driver travel, empty vehicle travel, reduced operating costs, increased convenience, and encouragement of sprawl. Factors reducing VMT include more convenient shared vehicle services, self-driving buses improving transit, and reduced traffic risk/parking making urban living more attractive.
-   **Why it is important**: This table directly addresses **Key Idea 3** by presenting the nuanced and often contradictory potential impacts of AVs on VMT. It demonstrates that AVs are not inherently VMT-reducing and highlights the need for policy intervention to steer outcomes towards desired reductions. It's a foundational piece for the "Travel Impacts" section.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 12
-   **Page**: 22
-   **Title/Caption**: Generalized Cost (Money and Time) Travel Demand Curve
-   **What it shows (content)**: This line chart plots "Generalized Cost Per Vehicle-Mile" (y-axis) against "Annual Vehicle Miles Per Traveler" (x-axis) for different transportation modes: Taxi/Ridehailing, Carshare, Autonomous Taxi, Shared Autonomous Ride, Current Car, Electric Car, and Autonomous Electric Car. The curve demonstrates a general inverse relationship: as the generalized cost per vehicle-mile decreases, the annual vehicle miles traveled per traveler increases. Autonomous Electric Cars are shown to have the lowest generalized cost and thus the highest projected annual VMT.
-   **Why it is important**: This figure visually supports the report's argument that reduced travel costs (both monetary and time-related) will likely *increase* total vehicle travel, not decrease it, directly linking to **Key Idea 3**. It shows that while shared AVs might reduce VMT compared to human-driven taxis, private autonomous vehicles (especially electric ones) could significantly increase individual VMT, thereby exacerbating congestion and other external costs.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 18
-   **Page**: 29
-   **Title/Caption**: Vehicle Technology Deployment Summary
-   **What it shows (content)**: This table summarizes the deployment cycle (in years), typical cost premium, and market saturation share for several past vehicle technologies: Automatic transmissions, Air bags, Hybrid vehicles, Subscription services (OnStar, TomTom), Navigation systems, and Electric vehicles. It shows deployment cycles ranging from 15 to 100+ years and varying saturation shares. For example, automatic transmissions took 50 years to reach 90% in the U.S., and electric vehicles have taken 100+ years to reach only 1% of total sales.
-   **Why it is important**: This table provides crucial historical context and evidence for **Key Idea 5**, which predicts a slow adoption rate for autonomous vehicles. It directly refutes optimistic predictions by demonstrating that complex vehicle technologies typically require decades for market penetration, even with mandates (like airbags). This evidence underpins the report's cautious timeline for AV deployment.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 22
-   **Page**: 32
-   **Title/Caption**: Comparing Benefits
-   **What it shows (content)**: This matrix compares how different AV deployment models (Costly Personal AVs, Inexpensive Personal AVs, Shared AVs, Shared AVs with TDM Incentives) align with ten community planning objectives (e.g., congestion reduction, traffic safety, social equity). A checkmark (✓) indicates achieving the objective, while an 'X' indicates contradicting it. It clearly shows that "Shared AVs with TDM Incentives" achieve the most objectives, while "Costly Personal AVs" and "Inexpensive Personal AVs" contradict many, particularly those related to congestion, roadway costs, energy/pollution, and sprawl.
-   **Why it is important**: This table is central to the report's policy recommendations and directly supports **Key Idea 4** (SAVs offer greater societal benefits) and **Key Idea 3** (policy is key). It provides a concise summary of which AV strategies are most beneficial from a community planning perspective, making a strong case for public policies that favor shared, efficiently managed autonomous mobility over private ownership.

-   **Table ID**: Exhibit 25
-   **Page**: 35
-   **Title/Caption**: Autonomous Vehicle Planning Issues
-   **What it shows (content)**: This table outlines a timeline (2020-2080s) for various autonomous vehicle planning issues, including reliability and safety, overall travel impacts, local vehicle traffic impacts, social equity, energy/emission impacts, parking/passenger loading, roadway design, mixed traffic planning, and potential AV mandates. For each issue, it specifies the "Analysis Required" and "Policies Required," and the approximate "Time" decade when these issues become prominent or policies are needed. For example, defining performance and data requirements for AV operation is needed in 2020-30, while considering AV lanes and their funding is 2050-70s.
-   **Why it is important**: This table provides a strategic roadmap for planners and policymakers, offering a long-term perspective on the challenges and necessary actions related to AV deployment. It underpins **Key Idea 5** by demonstrating that planning for AVs is a multi-decade endeavor with evolving needs, and also supports **Key Idea 3** by highlighting the necessity of policies across a wide range of issues.

## 5. Important Images / Figures (with page numbers)

-   **Figure ID**: (No ID provided, image of Waymo car)
-   **Page**: 1
-   **Title/Caption**: Waymo's self-driving taxis are a well-publicized example of autonomous vehicles.
-   **What the figure shows**: A photograph of a white Chrysler Pacifica minivan, clearly branded with "WAYMO" and its distinctive sensors (lidar dome on the roof, cameras, radar units). The vehicle appears to be on a suburban street.
-   **Why it is important**: This is the first visual in the document and serves as a direct, concrete example of the technology being discussed. It immediately grounds the abstract concept of "autonomous vehicles" in a real-world, recognizable product, setting the context for the entire report.

-   **Figure ID**: Exhibit 3
-   **Page**: 9
-   **Title/Caption**: Productivity and Relaxation While Travelling
-   **What the figure shows**: Two interior conceptual renderings of autonomous vehicles. The left image shows a car interior configured as a mobile office with a passenger working on a laptop. The right image (Volvo 360C concept) shows a car interior configured as a "REAL BED" with a passenger lying down, emphasizing relaxation.
-   **Why it is important**: This figure illustrates one of the primary anticipated "internal user benefits" of autonomous vehicles: the ability to utilize travel time for work, rest, or leisure. It supports the section on "Reduced Driver Stress, Improved Productivity and Mobility" and highlights a key consumer appeal of AVs, which in turn influences potential travel behavior and VMT increases, linking to **Key Idea 3**.

-   **Figure ID**: Exhibit 7
-   **Page**: 15
-   **Title/Caption**: Driverless Car "Platooning" (Chuen, et al. 2013)
-   **What the figure shows**: This exhibit contains two graphs and a diagram. The diagram shows multiple vehicles driving very closely together in a "platoon" led by a truck, illustrating the concept of platooning. The first graph shows "Fuel consumption by vehicle spacing and platoon size," indicating that as vehicle spacing decreases and platoon size increases, fuel consumption decreases significantly. The second graph shows "% Fuel saving for a full platoon" for different vehicle types (LV Truck, PV Truck, PV Car) over time, with savings reaching 10-12%.
-   **Why it is important**: This figure is crucial for understanding the concept of platooning, which is presented as a necessary condition for achieving several key external benefits of AVs, such as reduced congestion, fuel consumption, and emissions. The caption explicitly states this. It also highlights a potential cost/problem mentioned earlier – the requirement for dedicated lanes and new risks associated with platooning, directly supporting aspects of **Key Idea 3** regarding policy and infrastructure needs.

-   **Figure ID**: Exhibit 16
-   **Page**: 25
-   **Title/Caption**: Aircraft and Automobile Software Code Compared (GAO 2016)
-   **What the figure shows**: A bar chart comparing the "Millions of lines of code" for an F-22 U.S. Air Force jet fighter (6.5 million), a Boeing 787 Dreamliner (14 million), and a Modern luxury vehicle (100 million). The bar for the luxury vehicle is significantly longer, showing it has vastly more lines of code.
-   **Why it is important**: This figure provides strong visual evidence for the complexity of automotive software, particularly in modern vehicles that incorporate driver-assistance systems, which is a precursor to full autonomy. It underpins the report's argument that AV development is inherently difficult, prone to errors, and will require extensive testing and time, thus supporting **Key Idea 1** about skepticism towards rapid deployment and **Key Idea 5** about the long timelines.

-   **Figure ID**: Exhibit 17
-   **Page**: 28
-   **Title/Caption**: U.S. Population and Automobile Ownership (FHWA 2016)
-   **What the figure shows**: A line graph showing "Motor Vehicles Per Capita" in the U.S. from 1900 to 2010. The curve shows a gradual increase in vehicle ownership per capita, with a steeper rise from the 1920s to the 1960s, and then a leveling off, approaching saturation around the 1980s. The caption notes that it took decades for automobiles to become dominant travel modes.
-   **Why it is important**: This figure serves as powerful historical evidence to support **Key Idea 5** – the slow pace of technology adoption in the automotive sector. It illustrates that even fundamental innovations like the automobile took many decades to reach market saturation, providing a basis for predicting a similar, if not longer, timeline for autonomous vehicles.

## 6. Concepts, Definitions, and Terminology

-   **Term**: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) / Self-driving / Driverless / Robotic Vehicles
-   **Page(s)**: 1, 3, 7, and throughout the document
-   **Explanation**: Vehicles capable of sensing their environment and operating without human input. They can navigate and perform all driving tasks under specific or all conditions.
-   **Role in the document**: This is the central subject of the entire report, defining the technology being analyzed.

-   **Term**: Levels of Driving Automation (SAE J3016)
-   **Page(s)**: 8, 19
-   **Explanation**: A standard classification system from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation in all conditions). Level 5 vehicles can transport non-drivers and goods without any human intervention.
-   **Role in the document**: Provides a critical framework for understanding the capabilities and limitations of AVs at different stages of development, and for assessing which benefits are achievable at which levels of automation.

-   **Term**: Platooning
-   **Page(s)**: 13, 15, 16, 19, 33
-   **Explanation**: A driving mode where multiple vehicles travel close together at high speeds, electronically linked and synchronized. This is often led by a large truck.
-   **Role in the document**: Described as a mechanism to achieve significant benefits like reduced congestion, fuel consumption, and emissions. However, it requires dedicated lanes and introduces new risks, highlighting a planning challenge.

-   **Term**: External Costs
-   **Page(s)**: 4, 15, 16, 18, 19, 24, 41
-   **Explanation**: Costs imposed on other people or society by vehicle travel (e.g., congestion, pollution, crash risks, road/parking infrastructure costs) that are not borne by the vehicle user.
-   **Role in the document**: A central concept in the cost-benefit analysis. The report argues that AVs may increase these costs if they induce more vehicle travel, making them economically inefficient without proper pricing and policy.

-   **Term**: Social Equity Impacts (Horizontal and Vertical Equity)
-   **Page(s)**: 4, 16-17, 18, 19, 32, 35, 36, 40
-   **Explanation**: Refers to the fairness of AV benefits and costs distribution. Horizontal equity concerns whether similar groups are treated similarly (e.g., subsidies). Vertical equity concerns favoring people with greater needs or lower incomes (e.g., affordable mobility options for non-drivers).
-   **Role in the document**: An important dimension of the report's comprehensive evaluation, highlighting that AV deployment could exacerbate existing inequalities if not managed with policies promoting affordability and fair access.

-   **Term**: Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
-   **Page(s)**: 14, 32, 36, 41
-   **Explanation**: Strategies aimed at influencing travel behavior to reduce vehicle use, shift to more efficient modes, or spread demand over time/space. Examples include road pricing, incentives for shared mobility, and public transit improvements.
-   **Role in the document**: Presented as crucial policy tools to mitigate the negative impacts of AVs (like increased VMT and congestion) and maximize their potential benefits, especially when combined with shared AV services.

-   **Term**: Innovation S-Curve
-   **Page(s)**: 25
-   **Explanation**: A model of technology deployment characterized by slow initial adoption (development, testing), followed by rapid growth (market expansion, product improvement, diffusion), and eventually leveling off (maturation, saturation) and decline.
-   **Role in the document**: Used as a framework to predict the likely, slow adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, providing a more realistic timeline than overly optimistic industry projections.

## 7. Constraints, Limitations, and Open Questions

-   **Uncertainty about AV Development and Impacts** (Page 3, Executive Summary; Page 7, Introduction; Page 39, Conclusions)
    -   **Explanation**: The document frequently states that there is "considerable uncertainty" concerning AV development, benefits, costs, travel impacts, and consumer demand. This is due to the complexity of the technology, the dynamic nature of future policies, and unpredictable consumer choices.
    -   **Page and section**: Executive Summary (Page 3), Introduction (Page 7), Conclusions (Page 39).
-   **Technical Obstacles and Performance Limitations** (Page 3, Executive Summary; Page 7, Introduction; Page 26, Development and Deployment Predictions)
    -   **Explanation**: AVs face significant technical hurdles, such as operating reliably in mixed urban traffic, heavy rain/snow, unpaved/unmapped roads, or with unreliable wireless access. Level 5 autonomy, in particular, may be infeasible for decades. Current systems still struggle with unexpected situations and high failure rates.
    -   **Page and section**: Executive Summary (Page 3), Introduction (Page 7), "Development and Deployment Predictions" (Page 26).
-   **Ethical Dilemmas - The Trolley Problem** (Page 14, Traffic Safety and Public Health)
    -   **Explanation**: Autonomous vehicles raise complex ethical questions about how they should be programmed to make life-or-death decisions in unavoidable accident scenarios (e.g., who to protect, how to prioritize risks to occupants vs. other road users). These decisions are explicit programming choices, unlike spontaneous human reactions.
    -   **Page and section**: "Traffic Safety and Public Health" (Page 14).
-   **Cost-Benefit Underestimation in Optimistic Reports** (Page 3, Executive Summary; Page 11, Ownership and Operating Costs)
    -   **Explanation**: Optimistic predictions often ignore or underestimate significant costs like cleaning, vandalism repairs, profits, empty vehicle travel, insurance, and efficient roadway user fees, leading to an exaggeration of future benefits.
    -   **Page and section**: Executive Summary (Page 3), "Ownership and Operating Costs" (Page 11).
-   **Requirement for Dedicated Lanes for Full Benefits** (Page 5, Executive Summary; Page 15, External Cost; Page 19, Benefits and Costs; Page 33, Roadway Design)
    -   **Explanation**: Many potential benefits, such as reduced congestion, increased road capacity, and optimal platooning, can only be achieved if AVs operate in dedicated lanes, which are costly, socially inequitable, and complex to implement.
    -   **Page and section**: Executive Summary (Page 5), External Cost (Page 15), Benefits and Costs (Page 19), Roadway Design (Page 33).
-   **Role of Public Policy is Crucial and Unpredictable** (Page 6, Executive Summary; Page 7, Introduction; Page 24, Travel Impacts; Page 31, Deployment Predictions; Page 36, Potential Conflicts and Solutions)
    -   **Explanation**: The ultimate impacts of AVs (whether they increase or reduce VMT, congestion, or improve equity) will depend heavily on public policies regarding road pricing, dedicated lanes, encouragement of shared mobility, and land use planning. The specific policies adopted are an open question.
    -   **Page and section**: Executive Summary (Page 6), Introduction (Page 7), "Travel Impacts" (Page 24), "Deployment Predictions" (Page 31), "Potential Conflicts and Solutions" (Page 36).

## 8. Notes for the Storytelling / Presentation Agent

-   **Key Ideas to emphasize**:
    -   **For a technical audience**: Emphasize **Key Idea 1** (Skepticism Towards Optimistic AV Timelines and Benefits) and the evidence from Exhibit 16 (Page 25) on software complexity, and **Key Idea 5** (Widespread Significant Impacts of AVs Are Decades Away) with historical deployment data from Exhibit 18 (Page 29). Also, details on technical obstacles from Page 26.
    -   **For a non-technical audience**: Focus on **Key Idea 3** (AVs Will Not Inherently Reduce Traffic Problems; Policy is Key) and **Key Idea 4** (Shared Autonomous Vehicles Offer Greater Societal Benefits), using Exhibit 22 (Page 32) as a compelling visual. The "Trolley Problem" (Page 14) is also highly engaging.

-   **Tables and figures for embedding**:
    -   **Exhibit ES-1 (Page 3) - Cost Comparison**: Excellent for summarizing costs for any audience. Can be used early to set expectations about AV affordability.
    -   **Exhibit ES-2 (Page 5) - Sales, Fleet, Travel and Benefit Projections**: This is the single most important visual to convey the report's timeline and the phased realization of benefits. Crucial for both technical and non-technical audiences to show "it's coming, but slowly and with caveats."
    -   **Exhibit 1 (Page 8) - Automated Driving Levels (SAE J3016)**: Essential for a technical audience to define terms, and useful for non-technical audiences to understand the different levels of automation.
    -   **Exhibit 2 (Page 8) - Operating Models Compared**: Great for illustrating the strategic choice between private and shared AVs and their respective pros/cons, supporting policy discussions.
    -   **Exhibit 12 (Page 22) - Generalized Cost (Money and Time) Travel Demand Curve**: Powerful visual for explaining why AVs might *increase* VMT due to lower perceived costs. Very good for a policy-oriented story.
    -   **Exhibit 16 (Page 25) - Aircraft and Automobile Software Code Compared**: A striking visual for a technical audience to emphasize the complexity challenges of AV development.
    -   **Exhibit 17 (Page 28) - U.S. Population and Automobile Ownership**: Strong historical evidence to support the slow deployment timeline; good for grounding expectations.
    -   **Exhibit 22 (Page 32) - Comparing Benefits**: A very effective summary table to guide policy decisions toward shared AVs with TDM. Ideal for a presentation on policy implications.
    -   **Exhibit 25 (Page 35) - Autonomous Vehicle Planning Issues Timeline**: Useful for a technical or planning audience to show the long-term scope of planning.

-   **Natural narrative arcs**:
    -   **Problem (Optimistic Hype) → Realistic Assessment (Challenges & Slow Deployment) → Solutions (Policy & Shared Mobility) → Implications**: This arc naturally follows the document's structure, starting with challenging common perceptions and then building a case for a more measured, policy-driven approach.
    -   **What AVs Are → What AVs Promise → What AVs Actually Entail (Costs, Risks, Timelines) → How We Can Steer Them for Good**: This focuses on education and guiding policy.

-   **Sections to downplay or skip in a high-level story**:
    -   The very detailed list of references might be too granular for a high-level overview, though specific references could be pulled out if needed to support a particular point.
    -   Some of the very specific sub-bullets within the benefits/costs or travel impacts could be condensed for a high-level audience. The key is to capture the *essence* of the trade-offs, not every single example.
