### Executive Summary: Challenges at Every Turn
-   **Page range:** Pages 6-7
-   **Summary:** The executive summary sets the tone for 2025, describing it as a "tumultuous and uncertain" year for the fashion industry, marked by a cyclical slowdown, increased consumer price sensitivity, rise of "dupes," accelerating climate change, and reshuffling of global trade. Revenue growth is expected to stabilize in low single digits, with non-luxury driving economic profit for the first time since 2010 (excluding Covid-19). Fashion leaders express pessimism, with only 20% expecting improvement. Geographic drivers are shifting, with Europe benefiting from falling inflation and tourism, the US from high-net-worth individuals, and Asia's new growth engines counteracting uncertainty in China.
    -   **Acting on Opportunities:** To navigate this, executives plan to localize go-to-market models, broaden price ranges, and focus on brand positioning to emphasize value. Resale and off-price segments will expand. Improving the in-store shopping experience with well-trained staff is crucial as physical retail returns. Pure-play luxury marketplaces are struggling, and mass online marketplaces may face similar disruption. Smart e-commerce focuses on AI-powered curation and search for product discovery. Brands are also targeting the "Silver Generation" (over-50s) as a growing consumer cohort. Ongoing shifts in global trade necessitate supply chain reconfiguration towards nearshoring and geopolitically aligned countries, with a focus on agility, inventory reduction, and new technology. Sustainability remains a top agenda item due to climate crisis costs and government action, despite consumer reluctance to pay extra for planet-friendly products. The report concludes that the "old playbook is now obsolete" and a "new formula for differentiation and growth" is needed.

### Industry Outlook: The Market Share Game Levels Up
-   **Page range:** Pages 8-13
-   **Summary:** This section details the overall industry sentiment and growth expectations for 2025.
    -   **Uncertainty persists as executives enter 2025 with less optimism for the year ahead (Page 9):** The most common sentiment among fashion leaders for 2025 is "uncertainty," with only 20% expecting improved conditions. Top risks cited are consumer confidence (70%) and geopolitical instability (67%). Inflation concerns have decreased.
        -   **Figure (Page 9):** "Question: What aspects of the global economy do you expect will be the greatest risks to growth in the fashion industry in [year]? Select three %" shows a shift in perceived risks from 2023 to 2025. Inflation was the top risk in 2023 (78%) and 2024 (51%), but drops to 28% in 2025, replaced by Consumer confidence and appetite to spend (70%) and Geopolitical instability (67%) as top concerns.
    -   **Fashion industry growth is expected to remain low, but increase slightly from 2024 (Page 10):** The McKinsey Fashion Growth Forecasts predict low single-digit growth in 2025, a structural deceleration post-pandemic. Brands will focus on market share capture rather than overall market growth. Retail sales year-on-year growth for non-luxury and luxury segments are provided for Europe, US, and China, showing varied growth trajectories.
    -   **The macroeconomic climate will continue to challenge growth across regions (Page 11):** Provides GDP growth forecasts and specific growth drivers for non-luxury and luxury segments in Europe, US, and China. Europe's non-luxury is expected to grow +1-3% with rising real wages and falling inflation. US luxury is forecast at +3-5% driven by aspirational middle/upper-class consumers and UHNWI population growth. China's non-luxury GDP growth is decelerating to 4.5% amidst a property market crisis, with luxury expected to pick up slightly in late 2025 (+3-0%) due to high savings rates and new wealth centers, but domestic growth below historical levels.
    -   **Fashion executives expect volume, rather than price, to drive modest growth in 2025 (Page 12):** Executives prioritize sales growth, but the drivers are shifting from price to volume. The number of executives expecting to increase prices dropped 17% points. Nearly two-thirds expect low single-digit volume growth, indicating consumers are tired of price increases, especially middle/lower-income shoppers.
        -   **Figure (Page 12):** "Question: How much do you expect your like-for-like retail sales volumes...?" and "Question: How much do you expect to increase / decrease your retail sales prices...?" illustrates that a higher percentage of executives expect volume growth (1-5% at 40%) compared to price increases (More than 5% at 11%).
    -   **To capture market share, fashion executives are focusing on differentiation (Page 13):** Differentiation is the top priority (13% of respondents for 2025), followed by leveraging AI (9%) and improving economics in select regions (9%). Localization of go-to-market models, broadening price ranges, and altering assortments are key levers. Focus on cost improvements and sustainability has reduced compared to previous years.
        -   **Figure (Page 13):** "Question: What do you think will be the single biggest opportunity for the fashion industry in [year]?" highlights differentiation as the leading opportunity for 2025.

### Global Economy (Pages 14-38)

#### Theme 01: Trade Reconfigured
-   **Page range:** Pages 16-24
-   **Summary:** This theme discusses the shifting landscape of global trade and its implications for the fashion industry, particularly the acceleration of sourcing diversification and nearshoring.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 17):** Trade barriers and supply disruptions increased 5x since 2015. US apparel/textile imports are diversifying fastest away from China. Apparel manufacturing FDI into nearshoring regions increased significantly (20%points for US, 8%points for EU).
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 17):** Regularly assess and reconfigure sourcing footprint considering net margin and cash benefits. Collaborate closely with suppliers for resilient supply chains. Partner with industry stakeholders (regulators, manufacturers) for sustainability goals.
    -   **Global economies are diversifying sourcing and reducing the geopolitical distance of trade flows (Page 18):** Global trade is moving from a US-China centric model to a "multi-polar" structure. Between 2017-2023, US imports from China fell 5.8%, and the EU reduced its trade deficit with China by 27%. Major economies are reducing trade flows with less politically aligned countries.
        -   **Figure (Page 18):** "Change in goods trade indicators, 2017-2023, %" shows decreases in import concentration and geopolitical distance for China, US, Germany, and UK, indicating diversification and reduced political alignment in trade.
    -   **Diversification of apparel and textiles sourcing will likely continue at pace in the years to come (Page 19):** Fashion brands are increasing supply chain resilience by diversifying sourcing. China's share of apparel/textile imports decreased for both US and EU (6%points and 3%points respectively, 2019-2023). India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh are becoming key sourcing hubs. Nearshoring to destinations like Mexico/Canada (for US) and North Africa/Eastern Europe (for EU) is expected to increase.
        -   **Figure (Page 19):** "US apparel and textile imports, % of total value" and "Europe apparel and textile imports,d % of total value" bar charts show the shifting shares of imports from China, Asia Growth markets, Nearshoring, and Rest of Asia over time (2019, 2023, 2030E).
    -   **Rising sourcing costs, tariffs and sustainability targets may accelerate sourcing diversification (Page 20):** Asia-to-US shipping costs increased >165% between Dec 2023 and Feb 2024. Trade restrictions increased 5x since 2015. 63% of fashion brands need to accelerate emission reduction to meet 2030 targets. Labour costs in China are rising, and new EU import duties and US de minimis rule reviews add pressure. Country of production significantly influences GHG emissions.
    -   **Fashion brands will look to Asia growth markets such as India for manufacturing (Page 21):** India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh are top sourcing hotspots for the next five years, according to a McKinsey survey. India's government investments and reforms are easing production capability challenges. Bangladesh faces political and climate disruptions, causing brands to shift orders.
        -   **Figure (Page 21):** "Top-ranked sourcing hotspots for the next five years, Share of apparel CPO respondents including country in top three, %" bar chart shows India (46%), Vietnam (46%), Bangladesh (43%), and Indonesia (22%) as top choices, with corresponding %point change from 2019-2023.
    -   **Renewed interest in nearshoring is leading to increased capacity and improved capabilities (Page 22):** Mentions of nearshoring in corporate presentations increased 20-fold. FDI in nearshoring apparel manufacturing increased 20%points for US and 8%points for Europe. Government incentives (e.g., Americas Act in US, EU Strategy for Sustainable Textiles) support nearshoring. Productivity improvements, vertical integration, and faster speed-to-market (3-5x faster lead times, higher margins, lower inventory) are key benefits.
        -   **Figure (Page 22):** "Apparel and textile manufacturing foreign direct investments, % of total" bar charts for US and Europe show the shift from Farshoring to Nearshoring between 2015-2019 and 2020-2024.
    -   **Latin America is emerging as a key nearshoring hub for the US, as is Turkey for Europe (Page 23):** 65% of US fashion companies increased sourcing from USMCA members (Mexico) in 2023 due to trade agreements and investments. Mexico-US shipping is faster and cheaper than China. Guatemala's apparel/textile exports to US increased 10% (2020-2023). Turkey's share of global textile production doubled, reaching 6% of Europe's textile/apparel exports in 2023, surpassing Vietnam. Turkey offers faster order-to-fulfillment times (under 50 days vs 150-170 in Asia-Pacific).
        -   **Figure (Page 23):** A map highlights Latin America (Columbia, SAE-A) and Turkey (Shein, Kipas Textiles) as emerging nearshoring hubs.
    -   **Flexible supply chains and close supplier relationships will be critical to success (Page 24):** This section outlines executive priorities for optimizing sourcing footprint, developing strategic relationships with manufacturers/suppliers, and shaping trade flows with industry stakeholders. It emphasizes data-driven footprint assessments, collaborative planning, and co-investments to build resilient supply chains.

#### Theme 02: Asia’s New Growth Engines
-   **Page range:** Pages 25-38
-   **Summary:** This theme focuses on the changing dynamics of Asian fashion markets, particularly the deceleration of China's economy and the rise of other Asian countries as growth drivers.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 26):** Fashion executives are increasingly positive about Asian growth prospects outside of China, especially India, Japan, and Korea (54% positive net sentiment). India is a key mid-market segment (12-17% growth in 2025). Japan's luxury market grew 25-30% in H1 2024, fueled by currency weakness and tourism.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 26):** Increase localization of go-to-market models to resonate with local consumer preferences. Build regional omnichannel capabilities in owned and third-party channels.
    -   **As China’s sizeable GDP growth slows, so will its fashion market’s growth (Page 27):** China's economy, the second largest apparel market, is projected to grow by 4.5% in 2025, but this reflects a deceleration from previous decades. The IMF forecasts further GDP growth decline to 3.3% by 2029 due to aging consumers and slower productivity. Apparel sales growth in H1 2024 (1.3%) was half of 2019 levels. Consumer confidence is near record lows, and debt-to-GDP ratio is at a historic high.
        -   **Figure (Page 27):** Two large numbers: "3 points projected decrease in percentage points in China’s annual GDP growth rate from 2019 to 2029 by the IMF" and "36 points decrease in Chinese consumer confidence index points from January 2022 to July 2024".
    -   **This deceleration, coupled with changing consumer preferences, is challenging growth (Page 28):** In the non-luxury segment, domestic brands are gaining share (6%points vs international brands, 2013-2023). In luxury, China's growth slowed to negative 3% from 12% in 2023. "Luxury shame" drives demand for "quieter" and more affordable products. Chinese luxury spend abroad is projected to increase, but still below 2019 levels.
        -   **Figure (Page 28):** "Non-luxury apparel market in China, sales of top 20 domestic vs international brands, %" and "Chinese consumers’ spend on personal luxury goods in mainland China domestic vs international, %" show the shift towards domestic brands in non-luxury and away from international luxury within mainland China.
    -   **Fashion executives have a positive outlook for other Asian countries, particularly India and Japan (Page 29):** One in five executives mentioned India as a focus market for 2025. Luxury executives show high sentiment for Japan and Korea. Emerging APAC countries like Indonesia and Thailand are also gaining prominence.
        -   **Figure (Page 29):** "Fashion executive sentiment towards market growth prospects in 2025 vs 2024, %" bar chart illustrates net sentiment for China (-18%), India (+54%), Other APAC mature (+54%), and Other APAC emerging (+44%).
    -   **India is poised to become a key fashion market due to a strong mid-market and potential in luxury (Page 30):** India is expected to be the fourth largest economy in 2025, becoming the world's third-largest consumer market by 2027. Non-luxury growth is fueled by a massive and growing middle class (430 million people, expected to reach 1 billion by 2050) and digitisation. Luxury growth is fueled by a rapidly growing UHNWI population (50% growth 2023-2028), aspirational customers, and increased luxury retail infrastructure.
        -   **Figure (Page 30):** "Retail sales year-on-year growth by geography and segment, 2025E, %" bar charts show India with the highest growth rates for both Non-luxury (12-17%) and Luxury (15-20%) compared to US, Europe, and China.
    -   **Fashion brands looking to succeed in India need to consider its unique obstacles and nuances (Page 31):** Key considerations include infrastructure challenges (limited high-quality retail real estate, last-mile delivery), partner selection and operating model, local consumer dynamics (influence of Indian culture, preference for jewelry over apparel, rise of local fast fashion), and regulatory requirements (local sourcing, high regional taxes).
        -   **Figure (Page 31):** "Number of international brands that launched or plan to launch in India, 2023-2025" bar charts show an increase in non-luxury and luxury brands entering India. Examples of brands expanding in India (Mango, Decathlon, Bulgari) are also listed.
    -   **The yen’s weakness made Japan a major international shopping destination in 2024 (Page 32):** Japan's luxury fashion market grew 25-30% in H1 2024, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The yen's depreciation against the dollar (38-year low) attracted luxury shoppers and fueled record-high duty-free sales. Tourism has fully recovered, with visitors up 66% from 2023.
        -   **Figure (Page 32):** "Recovery rate for tax-free shopping spend in Japan compared to 2019, %" line chart shows a sharp increase in recovery rate from 98% in Q1 2023 to 327% in Q2 2024.
    -   **International and domestic luxury spend continue to propel the market in Japan (Page 33):** Japanese luxury market is expected to grow 8-12% in 2025. Positive price dynamics and inbound tourism will fuel growth. Domestic demand is robust, driven by Japanese customers (significant portion of luxury sales) and a large UHNWI population.
        -   **Figure (Page 33):** "Luxury fashion market year-on-year growth by geography, 2025E, %" bar chart shows Japan with the highest luxury growth (8-12%) compared to US (3-5%), Europe (1-3%), and China (-3-0%).
    -   **A go-to-market fashion strategy that accounts for local nuances is crucial to success in Asia (Page 34):** This section outlines executive priorities for curating localized go-to-market approaches and developing strong omnichannel propositions. It emphasizes tailoring product portfolios, supply chains, pricing, and marketing messages to local preferences in different Asian markets (China: DTC/owned online; India: local online marketplaces; Japan: hyper-personalised retail services).
    -   **Myntra: An Online Gateway to India’s Fashion Market (Pages 35-38):** An interview with Nandita Sinha, Myntra’s CEO.
        -   Myntra, an Indian e-commerce giant, is helping brands reach young, aspirational, and trend-conscious consumers. It focuses on influencer-led content, scaling premium offerings, and leveraging India’s sourcing capabilities. Myntra highlights India’s unique position with both sourcing and consumption capacity, driven by rising incomes, young customers, and internet penetration. The platform is crucial for overcoming physical retail infrastructure shortages. Sinha notes that traditional wear is bigger but western wear is fast-growing, and premiumisation is a key trend. Myntra uses AI for product discovery, styling assistance (MyFashionGPT, My Stylist, Maya chatbot), and content curation (Myntra Minis, Glam Clan) to enhance customer experience, improve conversions, and reduce return rates.

### Consumer Shifts (Pages 39-72)

#### Theme 03: Discovery Reinvented
-   **Page range:** Pages 39-47
-   **Summary:** This theme explores how fashion shoppers are overwhelmed by choice and how AI-powered curation is set to transform product discovery.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 40):** 50% of fashion executives see product discovery as the key use case for generative AI in 2025. 82% of customers want AI to reduce research time. OpenAI's GPT-4o is 15-20% more accurate than predecessors.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 40):** Build AI foundations and identify tech partners. Prioritize high-value use cases with a test-and-learn approach. Implement internal guidelines for appropriate AI use, ensuring brand tone and values.
    -   **Choice paralysis is negatively impacting customer experience; brands are struggling to address it (Page 41):** 74% of customers abandon online purchases due to too much choice. 80% are dissatisfied with online search. Retailers are responding by reducing offerings (Asos) and using generative AI (Revolve, Kering's Madeline).
    -   **Reinventing product discovery will be a key focus area for fashion players in 2025 (Page 42):** Customer product discovery and search is the top-ranked AI use case for executives. This is driven by growing demand for AI-powered experiences (79% find AI helpful, 82% want AI to reduce research time), increased competitiveness among tech players driving quality and cost improvements (Google DeepMind's Gemini, Meta's Llama 3.1), greater accuracy of AI tools (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet), and emerging commercial successes (Zalando's generative AI features).
        -   **Figure (Page 42):** "Generative AI use cases with the most potential in 2025, according to fashion executives, %" bar chart shows Product discovery and customer search (50%) as the top use case.
    -   **This new era will provide customers with increased curation across search and content (Page 43):** The shift is from long, linear, non-personalised search results to contextual, highly personalised recommendations (Daydream, Constructor). From basic filters to real-time recommendations and frictionless search (Zalando, Alibaba). From content based on past interactions to integrated social commerce with end-to-end journeys driven by predictive models (TikTok, Pinterest).
        -   **Table (Page 43):** "INDUSTRY SHIFTS EXPECTED IN 2025" table contrasts "FROM" (current state) with "TO" (future state with AI-enabled discovery) and provides "EXAMPLES" (Daydream, Constructor, Zalando, Alibaba, TikTok, Pinterest).
    -   **Emerging AI challengers are redefining product search for the fashion industry (Page 44):** AI-powered shopping platforms like Daydream (2,000+ brands onboarded) leverage generative AI, ML, and computer vision for highly personalized search. Capsule (99% user image match) focuses on alternative search methods. AI-powered discovery partners like Constructor (20x ROI increase for some brands) enable brands to embed AI in search for personalized experiences.
    -   **Multi-brand retailers with vast product data are driving change in content curation (Page 45):** Taobao and Tmall Group (Alibaba) introduced Wenwen, a large language model chatbot, leading to a 30% improvement in click-through rate with personalized content. Zalando is investing in generative AI for product discovery and inspiration, with its AI assistant used by over 500,000 customers.
    -   **Social media will continue to change the way shoppers discover and purchase fashion (Page 46):** Brand discovery through social media is as common as through search engines. The social commerce market in the US and UK is expected to almost double by 2027, driven by predictive algorithms (TikTok's "For You" page), content tools (generative AI solutions), and integrated shopping journeys (TikTok Shop).
        -   **Figure (Page 46):** "Social commerce market, USD (billions)" bar chart shows projected growth in social commerce for US (from $76B in 2023 to $130B in 2027) and UK (from $8B in 2023 to $23B in 2027).
    -   **Fashion players should adopt a value-focused approach to AI-enabled discovery (Page 47):** This section outlines executive priorities for building AI foundations (embed AI literacy, establish tech backbone, identify partners, optimize product data), prioritizing value and accuracy before scaling (identify high-value use cases, test-and-learn, assess trade-offs between relevance and monetisation), and managing risks and ethics (best practice frameworks, continuous monitoring of AI models, human validation, balance with brand tone).

#### Theme 04: Silver Spenders
-   **Page range:** Pages 48-60
-   **Summary:** This theme highlights the increasing importance of older consumers ("Silver Generation") for fashion brands.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 49):** People aged 50+ will drive 48% of incremental global spending in 2025. In China, 38% of population will be 50+ by 2025. Those 55+ in US account for 72% of wealth in 2024.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 49):** Rethink marketing segmentation based on values, not just age. Assess product range for universal appeal, investing in versatile designs and functional materials. Establish KPIs for long-term ROI of mature customers across inter-generational marketing.
    -   **It will be increasingly difficult for fashion brands to drive growth from younger generations alone (Page 50):** 73% of US Gen-Z report changing spending habits due to increased prices. Gen-Z is less brand-loyal (50% prefer to explore new brands). 80% of Gen-Z feel overwhelmed by brand exposure. Competition for younger shoppers is high, despite many brands focusing on them.
    -   **Meanwhile, there is a growing “Silver Generation” cohort of fashion customers (Page 51):** Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates mean over-50s are growing faster than other cohorts. In 2020, they were 25% of global population, expected to be over a third by 2050. This trend is starker in advanced economies (US, EU5, China) and growing in emerging markets (India).
        -   **Figure (Page 51):** "Population by age cohort, Millions" bar charts for US, China, EU5, and India illustrate the increasing proportion of older age groups (50-69yr, 70yr+) from 2020 to 2050E.
    -   **The Silver Generation is disproportionately wealthier and spends more on fashion (Page 52):** Older generations have accumulated wealth and steady incomes. 55+ in US accounted for 72% of wealth in early 2024. They are more resilient during economic uncertainty. They drive 48% of global spending growth in 2025, and represent a greater share of total fashion spend than younger shoppers.
        -   **Figure (Page 52):** "Total global incremental consumer spending in 2024 and 2025 by age, USD" bar chart shows Age 50+ as the largest contributor to spending in 2024 ($1,550B) and 2025E ($61.1T).
    -   **Fashion brands need to address the needs of the Silver Generation in order to capture their spend (Page 53):** Silver Generation customers spend less time shopping for clothes, are not trend-driven (prioritizing individual style), value functionality and comfort over style, and prioritize value over price. They are more likely to buy on discount.
        -   **Figure (Page 53):** "Fashion preferences of Silver Generation consumers, %point difference vs younger consumers" dot plot illustrates how Silver Generation's preferences differ from younger consumers across categories like Engagement, Identity, Trends, Comfort, Functionality, Versatility, Price, Value, Brand, and Quality.
    -   **Knowing where and how the Silver Generation discovers and shops for fashion is crucial (Page 54):** They are slower to embrace omnichannel shopping. Stores are a key destination for discovery. Multi-brand retail is preferred. Resale is low on their agenda, and they are less likely to buy sustainable brands, emphasizing quality over other attributes.
        -   **Figure (Page 54):** "Fashion purchase channel preference, %point difference vs younger consumers" bar chart shows Silver Generation's preference for various channels compared to younger consumers. They show higher preference for in-multi-brand physical stores and on-multi-brand e-commerce.
    -   **Inter-generational appeal is achievable with branding, marketing and product assortment (Page 55):** Examples of brands successfully appealing across generations: New Balance reclaimed "dad shoe" as fashion-forward, using retro styles and collaborations. J.Crew (interviewed by Cathaleen Chen) turned around by focusing on timeless, consistent assortment and showcasing longevity, reviving its catalogue. Uniqlo's LifeWear offers functional, high-quality everyday pieces with timeless designs and technical features, partnering with designers to attract younger demographics.
    -   **Brands that tailor their marketing, channel and product strategies will be positioned to win (Page 56):** This section outlines executive priorities for rethinking customer segmentation (value-based, not age-defined), diversifying product portfolio (fluid variants, new features for comfort/functionality), and defining a data-driven channel strategy (KPIs for long-term ROI, physical print, in-store experiences, social media like Facebook/WeChat).
    -   **J.Crew: How to Build an ‘Ageless’ Brand (Pages 57-60):** An interview with Libby Wadle, CEO of J.Crew.
        -   Wadle discusses J.Crew's turnaround post-bankruptcy by building a multi-generational brand focused on style, quality, and heritage. The strategy involved strong creative direction, enhancing the customer experience, and balancing classic items with evolved pieces. J.Crew's core customer is "ageless" in demographic, and they are attracting younger customers while retaining older ones. They emphasize quality and timelessness over fast fashion trends. Stores are seen as platforms for brand celebration and connection, while the relaunched catalogue provides inspiration across generations. The brand maintains balance between design process and supply chain, allowing for lead times for quality fabrics.

#### Theme 05: Value Shift
-   **Page range:** Pages 61-72
-   **Summary:** This theme explores how macroeconomic pressures are driving cost-conscious consumer behaviors and growth in value-oriented segments.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 62):** Fashion customers consistently adopt cost-conscious behaviors; 64% of US shoppers traded down in Q3 2024. Over 70% plan to shop from outlets/off-price retailers. Nearly 1 in 3 US adults intentionally bought a dupe, half for cost savings.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 62):** Identify and communicate a brand value proposition (price or quality). Emphasize value in communications. Embed value into product/channel strategy (new products/price points, resale/outlets) while protecting brand equity.
    -   **Fashion customers are looking to spend less and spend smarter (Page 63):** Consumer confidence remains low. Over 40% of shoppers in US, UK, Germany are spending less on clothing. Over 60% of US/UK consumers try to save money on fashion. Shoppers are trading down, buying from outlets/off-price retailers, using BNPL, or buying dupes.
        -   **Figure (Page 63):** Photo of a "SALE UP TO 50% OFF" sign in a clothing store window.
    -   **Even as economies improve, value-orientated behaviours are likely to persist (Page 64):** Shoppers are not eager to increase fashion budgets, prioritizing experiences and travel over fashion. Value-seeking behaviors (e.g., buying from off-price retailers, hunting best prices, waiting for discounts, buying/selling resale, buying dupes) are expected to persist.
        -   **Figure (Page 64):** "Behaviours that customers would continue even if they had more money to spend, %" bar chart lists various value-seeking behaviors, with "Purchase from an outlet or off-price retailer" being the top one (75%).
    -   **Affordability is propelling growth for off-price retailers and outlets (Page 65):** Off-price retailers (Burlington, Ross, TJX) are growing revenues and improving profitability (1.8x faster than broader market growth). Outlet channels and e-commerce off-price brands (BestSecret) are also growing rapidly. Quotes from TJX and Ross executives confirm the importance of value.
        -   **Figure (Page 65):** Photo of handbags and clothing on a rack in a TJ Maxx store.
    -   **Consumer search for value is driving wins in the resale market (Page 66):** US resale market grew 15x faster than broader clothing retail. Expected to reach $350B by 2028. 60% of consumers perceive more value from secondhand apparel. Players like ThredUp and Vinted broke even in 2023. Brands like Sandro and Shein are developing their own resale capabilities.
        -   **Figure (Page 66):** Photo of secondhand fashion on a rail, with a "THREDUP" bag.
    -   **The pursuit of affordable alternatives has given rise to “dupe mania” (Page 67):** Gen-Z popularized "dupes" (duplicates of expensive products). Nearly one third of US adults intentionally bought a dupe. #dupe hashtag on TikTok has 6B views. Examples: Shein uses influencers to promote dupes. Quince builds on "same, but cheaper" principle. Lululemon hosted a pop-up to swap dupes for real leggings.
        -   **Figure (Page 67):** Photo of Lululemon leggings in store.
    -   **Brands looking to differentiate will need to convince shoppers that they are worth the price (Page 68):** This section outlines executive priorities for identifying value drivers (quality or affordable prices), communicating value (craftsmanship, quality, innovation, competitive prices), and integrating value into channel/product strategy (alternative channels, differentiated products, owned outlets, resale platforms, "premiumisation" of select lines).
    -   **Ralph Lauren: Selling a Dream at Every Price (Pages 69-72):** An interview with Patrice Louvet, CEO of Ralph Lauren.
        -   Louvet discusses Ralph Lauren's strategy of "world building" to create an aspirational dream accessible at various price points, from polo shirts to high-end watches. This strategy ensures value for investment, even as prices rise. The brand leverages a broad portfolio and strong storytelling across all touchpoints (stores, website, wholesale partners) to appeal to both the "uber-rich" and those buying a "piece of the dream." China is a significant growth opportunity for Ralph Lauren, focusing on top-six cities and selling elevated products, with a shift to core, iconic products. The company aims for leadership in categories, not just participation.

### Fashion System (Pages 73-128)

#### Overview of 2025 Themes: Fashion System
-   **Page range:** Pages 14-15 (reiterated from earlier)
-   **Summary:** These pages provide a quick-look summary of the key insights and data points for Themes 06-10.
    -   **06. The Human Side of Sales:** Differentiating in-store experience is key, empowering store associates. 75% of shoppers spend more after high-quality service.
    -   **07. Marketplaces Disrupted:** Online non-luxury marketplaces face challenges after luxury e-commerce struggles. Share prices declined 77% (Jan 2021-Sep 2024).
    -   **08. Sportswear Showdown:** Challenger brands (57% economic profit in 2024) intensify battle with incumbents.
    -   **09. Inventory Excellence:** Inventory remains a challenge (2.5-5B items of excess stock in 2023). Greater emphasis on end-to-end planning with tech tools.
    -   **10. The Sustainability Collective:** Fragmentation and consumer reluctance to pay for sustainable products are barriers. 63% of brands behind 2030 decarbonisation goals.

#### Theme 06: The Human Side of Sales
-   **Page range:** Pages 73-86
-   **Summary:** This theme emphasizes the crucial role of human interaction in retail and how empowering store associates is key to reigniting demand for in-person shopping.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 74):** Store associates are key differentiators in customer satisfaction. 75% of shoppers likely to spend more after high-quality service. >20% of missed sales are due to suboptimal staff engagement or unavailability.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 74):** Enable staff with training and tech tools (CRM, analytics). Motivate staff with broader incentive structures beyond immediate sales. Optimize processes via automation to free up staff for conversion drivers. Evolve the associate role to focus on career progression and interpersonal connections.
    -   **It will be imperative to maximise customer engagement amid slowing in-store sales in 2025 (Page 75):** In-store sales growth is slowing to 1-2% in 2025. Store foot traffic is returning to pre-pandemic levels. Stores are now conversion and loyalty destinations, not just for discovery. Retailers need to differentiate the in-store experience, focusing on the "human side of sales."
        -   **Figure (Page 75):** Photo of women trying on clothes in a store.
    -   **Store associates are crucial in differentiating the store experience (Page 76):** Based on shopper satisfaction analysis, human interactions (advice, help finding items, styling advice) are "differentiators" that boost delight and drive loyalty. Non-human elements (checkout, fitting room, store characteristics) are "must-have hygienic factors."
        -   **Figure (Page 76):** A diagram "Drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in shopper store experience, Ranked by relative importance" categorizes elements into "Differentiator," "Must-have," "Hygienic," and "Baseline."
    -   **Solving human capital challenges is essential to retaining associates in today’s labour market (Page 77):** Over 60% of shoppers cite poorly trained staff as discontent cause. Retail workers are 1.2x more likely to leave than average US employees. Losing a frontline employee costs $2k-$10k. 75% of global companies operate without enough frontline employees.
    -   **Upskilling staff and investing in tech support tools will enable better customer interactions (Page 78):** Over half of executives see digital tools for omnichannel sales as a priority. Professional development for store associates is crucial. Training and skills certification improve employee retention. Examples: Kering's Luce app for tailored recommendations, Target's generative AI Store Companion, Reiss's AI-powered learning, Aritzia's "University" program.
    -   **Employee incentives should reward customer lifetime value and reflect modern shopping habits (Page 79):** Incentives should align with meaningful work and prioritize customer interactions/relationship-building. KPIs should reflect new ways of working, like onboarding loyalty members or driving omnichannel sales. Examples: Frasers Group's peer-nominated awards, Dior's performance-based points, Nordstrom's "Style Board" for digital sales commissions.
        -   **Figure (Page 79):** Photo of a Nordstrom store assistant and customer.
    -   **Store staff should be freed up to focus on customer-satisfaction drivers (Page 80):** Retailers use data-driven approaches for staff deployment. Technology can automate manual tasks (digital task management, ordering, production planning), freeing up staff time. RFID implementation across inventory processes can reduce labor hours by 10-15%. Customer-facing RFID use cases (self-checkout) are expanding. Examples: BJ's Wholesale uses robots for inventory, Uniqlo uses RFID self-checkout.
    -   **To improve employee experience, retailers should prioritise development and human interactions (Page 81):** Top reasons for retail employees leaving jobs: Career development (41%), Compensation (38%), Inspiring leaders (35%). Employees value relational elements of the job. Investing in career development and compensation is a "win-win."
        -   **Figure (Page 81):** "Top reasons why retail employees plan to leave their jobs, 2023" bar chart shows the percentages for different reasons.
    -   **It will be crucial for retailers to develop an end-to-end employee value proposition (Page 82):** Executive priorities: Embed cultural mindset that breaks down silos (collaboration, single source of truth, fact-based interventions). Widen accountability for inventory levels (organization-wide KPIs, ROI focus, dynamic buying). Leverage technology-enabled tools (customer-centric AI, ML, advanced analytics, data transparency, supplier involvement).
    -   **Aritzia: Redefining Shopping One Store at a Time (Pages 83-86):** An interview with Jennifer Wong, CEO of Aritzia.
        -   Wong discusses Aritzia's hypergrowth, driven by retail strategy and employee development. The brand emphasizes exceptional in-store experiences, personalized service by "people" people style advisors, appealing visual merchandising, and strategic store locations as primary marketing vehicles. Aritzia fosters employee loyalty through career opportunities, a positive work culture, and promoting from within. They prioritize product innovation, quality, and investing in infrastructure and technology. Wong highlights the importance of not "scrabbling to hire people" during tight labor markets, achieved by retaining existing staff even during Covid-19.

#### Theme 07: Marketplaces Disrupted
-   **Page range:** Pages 87-98
-   **Summary:** This theme addresses the significant challenges faced by online fashion marketplaces, particularly the "first wave" players, amidst new competitive dynamics and business model disruptions.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 88):** Europe's online fashion marketplaces (value/mid-market) destroyed $700M in economic profit in 2023. Shein and Temu challenge Amazon's lead in the US value segment. Douyin and Pinduoduo's monthly active app users increased significantly in China.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 88):** Make assortment a competitive advantage. Maximize customer lifetime value through best-in-class user experience. Improve profitability through B2B offerings and new consumer revenue streams. Modernize tech stack for optimal customer experience. Drive cost efficiency with AI in backend and frontend.
    -   **Online fashion marketplaces are facing existential business model challenges and disruptions (Page 89):** Customer acquisition costs are rising (60% increase 2017-2022). Return rates drag on profitability (20-30% of online fashion purchases are returned). Production complexity slows speed-to-market (Shein adds 2-10k new products daily). Customers want flexible omnichannel experiences, but online fashion sales growth is expected to drop 8% points. Necessary tech upgrades require investment (63% of executives plan to increase digital/tech investments).
    -   **The “first wave” of online marketplace players have struggled to sustain share price growth (Page 90):** Stock prices of pure-online marketplaces surged during Covid-19 but sharply declined since 2021, trading below 2018 levels. Investors now prioritize profitability over sales growth, impacting unprofitable businesses. Specialised fashion players (Asos, Boohoo) are particularly exposed.
        -   **Figure (Page 90):** "Monthly average share price development, 2018 – Sep. 2024, indexed to Jan. 2018 = 100" line chart shows the sharp decline in share price for non-exhaustive marketplaces (Boozt, Zalando, Alibaba, Boohoo, Asos, Global Fashion Group) after the Covid-19 store closures peak.
    -   **In Europe, online fashion marketplaces will need to evolve their business models (Page 91):** European online fashion marketplaces saw largest value destruction since 2010 ($700M in 2023). Four dynamics intensify: prioritising profitable orders (Zalando increased AOV), exploring new value pools (B2B operations), building scale (Mytheresa acquired Yoox-Net-a-Porter, Frasers Group increased stakes in Asos/Boohoo), and leveraging generative AI.
        -   **Figure (Page 91):** "Economic profit of European online fashion marketplaces, USD (millions)" bar chart shows the significant destruction of economic profit from 2021 to 2023, with a projected narrowing of losses in 2024E.
    -   **Amazon Fashion leads the US value segment; the mid and premium segments remain fragmented (Page 92):** Amazon Fashion leads the US online fashion market (>40% of revenue in 2023), defending against Shein/Temu by offering low-cost items and quick delivery. Potential threats: review of de minimis threshold for imports, TikTok's reach limitations. Mid-market/premium segments see department stores seizing omnichannel advantage, and fashion pure-players strengthening high-end portfolios.
        -   **Figure (Page 92):** "Selected marketplaces’ share of US total online fashion revenue 2023, %" bar chart shows Amazon Fashion's dominant share.
    -   **In China, managing social commerce profitability and the blend of branded vs value products is key (Page 93):** Social and live commerce are crucial in China. Douyin is popular for apparel shopping. Proliferation of players requires brands to balance distribution by: managing profitability of social commerce with livestreamers (high fees, discounts, high return rates), and balancing branded vs value items (Alibaba's low-price strategy, Pinduoduo attracting brands).
        -   **Figure (Page 93):** "Growth of monthly active users for major online platforms in fashion in China, June 2020 – June 2024, %" bar chart shows Douyin (52%), Pinduoduo (45%), and Taobao (31%) growth.
    -   **Five actions will support the longevity of first-wave marketplaces (Page 94):** Executive priorities: Make assortment a competitive advantage (curate, exclusive collections, minimize unproductive SKUs). Maximize customer lifetime value (owned marketing, paid advertising, personalization, loyalty benefits, CRM). Create new avenues for profitability (B2B services, subscription models). Modernize tech stack and talent (data analytics, flexible IT, top tech talent). Leverage AI to reduce operating costs (product descriptions, sizing charts, logistics, demand planning).
    -   **Mytheresa: Staying Ahead in Luxury E-Commerce (Pages 95-98):** An interview with Michael Kliger, CEO of Mytheresa.
        -   Kliger discusses Mytheresa's strategy to remain profitable in a challenging luxury e-commerce market by focusing on top-spending customers, driving full-price sales, and efficient operations. He anticipates stabilization and continued digital growth for luxury. While China is challenging, Mytheresa remains committed to the market through localization efforts. He believes luxury e-commerce can provide a luxurious experience by understanding customer needs for inspiration, efficiency, and speed, not just by replicating physical stores. Customer acquisition is critical, using fine-tuned digital marketing for predicted customer lifetime value and in-person events. Mytheresa also manages inventory efficiently and uses a bespoke approach to partnerships with brands and athletes, emphasizing shared values. The acquisition of Yoox-Net-a-Porter is part of broadening reach without diluting brand profiles.

#### Theme 08: Sportswear Showdown
-   **Page range:** Pages 99-112
-   **Summary:** This theme explores the intensifying competition in the sportswear market, where challenger brands are gaining significant economic profit.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 100):** Sportswear grew faster than broader fashion market in 2023 (2-6%points faster in China, US, Europe). Fast-growing challenger brands expected to make up 57% of sportswear economic profit in 2024 (nearly triple since 2020). Investors bullish on challengers, with significant share price gains.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 100):** Invest in product innovations (core franchises, new categories). Double down on product marketing to convey novelties. Build partnerships with ambassadors (macro/micro, emerging athletes). Develop clear DTC strategy for engagement and storytelling, and strategically use retail channels for reach.
    -   **Challenger brands will generate the majority of economic profit in sportswear in 2024 (Page 101):** Challengers (Deckers, Asics, On) are expected to create over 50% of the segment's value, surpassing incumbents (Nike, Adidas, Puma, Under Armour). Challengers grew revenues 18% YoY (2020-2024E), while incumbents saw profitability decline.
        -   **Figure (Page 101):** "Economic profit (EP) of publicly listed incumbent vs publicly listed challenger brands, 2018-2024E, %" stacked bar chart shows the shift in EP contribution from incumbents to challengers over time, with challengers dominating in 2024E.
    -   **Challenger brands have aggressively taken market share by targeting niches and expanding reach (Page 102):** Challenger brand playbook: Delivering visible innovation (Hoka's oversized midsoles, On's CloudTec® soles). Targeting specialized categories (Lululemon for women's athleticwear, Arc'teryx/Salomon for outdoor sports). Tapping into cultural marketing (New Balance/Alo Yoga with celebrities like Jack Harlow/Kendall Jenner, Vuori/Gymshark with grassroots communities, Hoka with running clubs). Filling wholesale whitespace (partnering with highly visited retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods/JD Sports).
    -   **In 2025, sportswear is expected to continue to grow faster than fashion overall (Page 103):** Sportswear growth is projected to outpace broader fashion by 2-6% points. Drivers: blurred boundary between fashion and activewear, prioritization of health/wellbeing, access to sports content/events. Two in three Millennials/Gen-Z wear athleisure multiple times weekly. Global sports tourism sector expected to grow 18% by 2030.
        -   **Figure (Page 103):** "Year-on-year growth of retail sales, by region and segment, %" bar charts compare sportswear and non-luxury fashion growth rates for Europe, US, and China from 2023 to 2025E, showing sportswear consistently higher.
    -   **The battle to capture share of this market growth will intensify in 2025 (Page 104):** Challengers (Asics, On, Deckers) saw significant share price gains (168%, 91%, 38% Jan-Sep 2024). Incumbents (Nike, Puma) saw negative development, except for Adidas with its Samba sneaker revival. This reinforces the need for incumbents to refresh strategies.
        -   **Figure (Page 104):** "Share price evolution of select sportswear players, Jan. 4, 2024 – Sep. 25, 2024, indexed to Jan. 4, 2024 = 100" line chart illustrates the divergent stock performance of challengers (Asics, On, Deckers) and incumbents (Adidas, Under Armour, Nike, Puma).
    -   **To win share, brands will diversify their offerings, balancing reach and cultural credibility (Page 105):** Challenger brands diversify to balance high participation sports with culturally credible ones. Performance and athleisure brands are expanding into each other's territories (Alo Yoga into running, On into training/tennis, Lululemon into golf/tennis). Material and product innovations are crucial (Nike most active in patents).
        -   **Figure (Page 105):** "Total US estimated participation vs fanbase of select sports, 2025" scatter plot maps sports by "Number of people who participate" and "Size of followership."
    -   **Players are expected to create authentic messaging amplified by ambassadors (Page 106):** Long-term athlete sponsorship (emerging talent, college athletes) is key. Celebrity endorsement for brand storytelling (Zendaya x On, Rosé x Puma). Convergence of sports and local culture (New Balance with local artists in Paris, Adidas' "In China, for China" strategy).
        -   **Figure (Page 106):** Photos of tennis player Coco Gauff, Zendaya for On, and an Adidas store in China.
    -   **Sportswear brands must strike the right balance between DTC and wholesale customer touchpoints (Page 107):** On and Hoka expand DTC. Nike and Adidas renew wholesale focus after DTC challenges. DTC for customer experience/community building (Adidas "The Pulse," Hoka flagship). Wholesale for reach/brand presence (partnerships with Dick's Sporting Goods, End; Lululemon with Zalando). Competition for shelf space is growing (Sports Direct, JD Sports, Foot Locker diversifying product range).
        -   **Figure (Page 107):** "Share of global DTC sales by brand, 2019-2023, %" line chart shows the evolution of DTC sales for Nike, Adidas, On, and Hoka.
    -   **Brands should prioritise product, marketing and distribution to gain share (Page 108):** Executive priorities: Invest in innovation (breakthroughs, diversify categories, reintroduce archival styles). Double down on marketing (compelling content, targeted strategies). Build authentic partnerships (athlete collaborations, celebrity alignment, local activations). Develop distribution strategy (DTC for engagement, retail partnerships for reach/profitability).
    -   **New Balance: Disrupting the Sneaker Industry (Pages 109-112):** An interview with Joe Preston, President and CEO of New Balance.
        -   Preston discusses New Balance's rapid growth ($6.5B in 2023, aiming for $10B) by controlling its destiny, staying attuned to trends, and operating with a challenger brand mindset. Key advantages include US manufacturing, strong quality, and significant investments in manufacturing and product innovation. They mine archives for retro designs that resonate with authenticity. New Balance balances direct sales (DTC) for brand presentation with wholesale for reach and profitability, and partners with athletes/designers who share the brand's values, using a bespoke approach.

#### Theme 09: Inventory Excellence
-   **Page range:** Pages 113-120
-   **Summary:** This theme highlights inventory management as a critical challenge for the fashion industry, driven by excess stock, stock-outs, margin pressures, and sustainability regulations.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 114):** Fashion industry produced 2.5-5B items of excess stock in 2023 ($70-140B in sales). Average share of discounted assortments increased 5%points in H1 2024. EU Ecodesign Regulation will require reporting on excess stock in 2025 and ban destroying unsold products in 2026.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 114):** Break down silos across the value chain for cross-functional decision-making. Incentivize inventory excellence across teams with dynamic management. Leverage tech tools for data integration and demand-responsive planning with suppliers.
    -   **Getting the fashion “inventory equation” right has become increasingly challenging (Page 115):** Inventory challenges are complex due to rapid trend cycles (micro-trends, 300% search volume increase in 12 months), unpredictable seasonality (climate change, temperature fluctuations), lengthy supply chains (limited flexibility, Suez Canal delays), and product/channel complexity (variety of channels, social commerce).
        -   **Figure (Page 115):** "Mean temperature and seasonal demand, Jan. 2019 – Jan. 2024, %" line chart illustrates how above-average temperatures negatively impact seasonal demand for winter clothing.
    -   **As a result, fashion brands continue to struggle with both excess stock and stock-outs (Page 116):** Excess stock (estimated $70-140B in 2023) is common (1/3 of brands struggling). Luxury inventories rose 2%points in H1 2024 (LVMH, Kering reported €5B excess). Discounting is widespread (Nike markdowns on 44% assortment). Stock-outs lead to missed revenue (20% average profit loss due to inaccurate buying). Lululemon attributed slower growth to insufficient inventory.
        -   **Figure (Page 116):** Photo of shipping parcels on a conveyor belt in a warehouse.
    -   **Managing inventory is key for brands to achieve profitability and address new regulation (Page 117):** Focus on profitability drives inventory optimization due to correlation between inventory turnover and profitability. High warehousing costs (10% increase in 2023) also push shift from unsold inventory. Sustainability regulations add pressure (EU Ecodesign Regulation, California EPR program). 60% of brands are behind on sustainability targets, making waste reduction critical.
        -   **Figure (Page 117):** "Inventory turnover vs profit margin, select publicly traded fashion brands, 2011-2023" scatter plot shows the relationship between EBIT margin and inventory turnover for various brands.
    -   **Fashion brands need to adopt proactive tactics to inventory management using tech-enabled tools (Page 118):** Proactive tactics are top strategies for 2025. Data-driven planning/forecasting tools (o9, Nextail, Blue Yonder) can reduce inventory by 5-15% and improve stock-outs by 15-25%. Dynamic open-to-buy adjustments (in-season purchases, "test and react" models) help control inventory. Network optimization with advanced analytics and digital twins improve efficiency.
        -   **Figure (Page 118):** "Fashion executives' top strategies for inventory optimisation in 2025, %" bar chart shows "Use data-driven planning and forecasting" as the top proactive tactic (75%).
    -   **Achieving sustained impact will require end-to-end collaboration across the value chain (Page 119):** Traditionally, inventory was managed in silos. End-to-end transformation can yield 10-15% cost savings. Five levers for collaboration: align clear roles, set up cross-functional teams, establish clear review cadence, align incentive structure, connect systems.
        -   **Figure (Page 119):** A circular diagram "Five levers to enable end-to-end planning collaboration" illustrates the interconnectedness of these levers for End-to-end planning collaboration.
    -   **Brands must reflect this change through an updated operating model and a mindset shift (Page 120):** Executive priorities: Embed processes/cultural mindset that breaks down silos (value chain collaboration, single source of truth, fact-based problem solving). Widen accountability for inventory levels (organization-wide KPIs, ROI focus, dynamic buying mindset). Leverage tech tools (customer-centric AI/ML, data transparency, supplier data sharing).

#### Theme 10: The Sustainability Collective
-   **Page range:** Pages 121-128
-   **Summary:** This theme emphasizes that inaction on sustainability is no longer an option, and the fashion sector must act collectively to drive impact, especially regarding decarbonisation.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 122):** 63% of brands are behind on 2030 decarbonisation goals. Only 18% of fashion executives consider sustainability a top-three risk for growth in 2025 (down from 29% in 2024). Apparel consumption projected to rise by 63% to 102M tonnes by 2030, potentially using over a quarter of world's carbon budget by 2050.
    -   **Executive Priorities (Page 122):** Set a "dual mission" (sustainability + profitability) through collective action. Consolidate and support suppliers (critical mass volumes, strategic relationships, shared decarbonisation roadmaps). Partner with traceability/impact measurement providers for granular data and attainable targets.
    -   **Complexity, fragmentation and consumer sentiment are barriers to sustainability targets (Page 123):** Over $1 trillion investment required for supply chain decarbonisation. 70% of emissions upstream, but suppliers struggle with costs. Industry is fragmented (300k+ brands, 60% global apparel production by small/medium suppliers). Disconnect between consumer actions/values: 50% of UK consumers avoiding fast fashion still bought from fast fashion retailer. Price is a more important consideration than sustainability for 61% of consumers.
    -   **As a result, brands, suppliers and innovators are struggling to make progress (Page 124):** Brands deprioritizing and scaling back commitments (63% behind 2030 goals, pushing back net zero targets). Suppliers deprioritizing sustainability due to feasibility/costs. Sustainable innovations struggling to scale (Renewcell bankruptcy, Bolt Threads paused Mylo production).
        -   **Figure (Page 124):** "Yearly reduction in scope-three emission intensity across the fashion industry by brand, %" scatter plot shows brands' progress towards 2030 targets, with many (40%) needing high acceleration.
    -   **Inaction is not an option. The fashion industry can focus on cost-effective decarbonisation (Page 125):** By 2030, global apparel consumption will significantly increase. Regulation (EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles) signals shift from voluntary action. Brands must act as value chain orchestrators. Cost-effective decarbonisation is possible: implementing sustainability levers can drive cost-efficiencies (up to 50% tier-two abatement can be cost-neutral). Dual savings possible (emissions + costs) through supplier collaboration on energy efficiency and waste reduction.
        -   **Figure (Page 125):** "Marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) for large fashion players" bar chart illustrates abatement potential vs. cost for various sustainability levers, showing many are cost-effective.
    -   **Long-term brand-supplier collaboration is an integral part of reducing industry emissions (Page 126):** Tier-two production (fabrics) accounts for 45-65% of scope-three emissions, yet 75% of brands don't involve suppliers in sustainability initiatives. Collective action needed: consolidate/partner on strategic commitments, embrace long-term commitments (volume offtakes, lead-time extensions, price premiums), collectively address bottlenecks (financing, policy engagement). Examples: H&M Group/Bestseller/CIP's offshore wind project in Bangladesh; Future Supplier Initiative (underwriting debt for decarbonisation); PVH Corp.'s financing program for suppliers.
    -   **Brands can create favourable conditions for sustainable-material innovators to scale (Page 127):** Few sustainable material start-ups have scaled. Brands must de-risk commercial prospects: fewer, bolder investments; de-risk commercials (funding, off-take agreements); build material-innovation muscle (in-house understanding, phased introduction). Examples: H&M Group/Syre (textile-to-textile polyester recycling); Inditex/Ambercycle (recycled polyester purchase commitment).
    -   **Brands can reignite progress if they focus on working with the broader fashion ecosystem (Page 128):** Executive priorities: Commit to sustainability initiatives (dual mission, collective action, commercialization). Rethink long-term supplier contracts (collaborative model for tier-two suppliers, aligned incentives, consolidate suppliers). Get granular on data (traceability/impact measurement partners, map entire value chain including tier-three suppliers).

### McKinsey Global Fashion Index

-   **Summary:** This section provides an in-depth analysis of the industry's economic profit (EP) and market dynamics, noting a shift where non-luxury players are catching up to luxury.
    -   **Key Insights (Page 130):** Industry EP grew 16% (2022-2023), expected to reach record-high levels in 2024. Non-luxury expected to generate more EP than any other segment in 2024 (first time since 2010, excluding Covid-19), driven by efficient operations and consumer downtrading. Luxury margins expected to drop 2%points in 2024. Top 20% of players expected to lose 13%points in value, bottom 20% gain 13%points, closing the gap. Luxury leads Super Winners list, but reshuffling expected.
    -   **The industry is expected to post record economic profit in 2024 (Page 131):** MGFI tracks 400 public companies. EP measures value created from adjusted operating profit minus cost of capital. Profitability improvements have driven EP gains. In 2023, 0.5%point margin improvement and 4% revenue growth led to 16% EP increase. 2024 forecast: 5% EP growth, 0.2%point margin boost, 3% revenue growth, stabilizing at 2.8x pre-Covid EP levels.
        -   **Figure (Page 131):** "Total economic profit (EP) development, Index (2010=100)" line chart shows the historical and forecasted EP, highlighting the recovery and projected record EP in 2024. "Year-on-year economic profit change, %" bar chart shows the annual percentage change.
    -   **However, record-high EP is not enough to allay investor uncertainty which drives lower valuations (Page 132):** Profitability gains have met investor expectations, but the share of valuation driven by future profit expectations has fallen, indicating investor uncertainty. Companies need compelling strategies for sustainable growth. Luxury enterprise value is trading slightly higher (19.2 EV/EBITA in 2024 vs 18.0 in 2022) but with slower growth. Non-luxury valuations decline to lowest multiples since 2012 (15.9 in 2024 vs 16.8 in 2022).
        -   **Figure (Page 132):** "Total economic profit (EP) development, Index (2010=100)" line chart and "EV/EBITA index (2010=100)" line chart visually compare EP development with enterprise value to EBITA.
    -   **The non-luxury segment is expected to buoy EP, marking a shift in industry dynamics (Page 133):** 2021-2022: luxury drove EP growth via price increases, other segments dragged EP down. 2023: non-luxury drove lion's share of value creation, luxury accounted for 11 points of 33-point EP increase. 2024: non-luxury expected to contribute more value (+30 index points), luxury less value.
        -   **Figure (Page 133):** "Change in industry EP by value segment contribution, 2021-2024E, Index (2010 industry EP=100)" stacked bar charts show the shifting contributions of luxury/affordable luxury and non-luxury to industry EP.
    -   **Consumer downtrading is driving non-luxury, while pricing and demand is challenging luxury (Page 134):** Luxury players can't rely on price increases without impacting demand, leading to promotions and compressed margins. China's consumer confidence sputter affects luxury. 64% of US shoppers traded down in Q3 2024. Non-luxury companies focus on cost-cutting and operational gains for profitability.
        -   **Figure (Page 134):** "Total economic profit (EP) by value segment, Index (2010 industry EP=100)" bar charts show EP development for Luxury, Premium/bridge, Mid-market, and Value/discount segments from 2021-2024E.
    -   **Cost cuts and operational gains have raised non-luxury margins, while luxury margins declined (Page 135):** Luxury segment EBITA margins expected to fall by 2%points (2023-2024), but remain higher than other segments. Non-luxury players (premium/bridge, mid-market) achieved record-high margins in 2023 through cost cuts and streamlined inventories. Examples: Inditex inventory reduction, Levi Strauss & Co. cost savings, Zalando margin growth. Affordable luxury and value/discount margins expected to grow but stay below historical peaks.
        -   **Figure (Page 135):** "EBITA margin by value segment, %" dot plot shows EBITA margins and their evolution for Luxury, Affordable luxury, Premium/bridge, Mid-market, and Value/discount segments.
    -   **23 percent of luxury players expect to generate more EP in 2024, driven by revenue gains (Page 136):** 77% of luxury segment EP comes from companies expecting negative EP growth (2023-2024), due to plateauing revenues and reduced EBITA margins. 23% of luxury EP comes from companies expecting positive EP growth, driven by revenue gains but flat margins. Overall luxury EP growth will be modest.
        -   **Figure (Page 136):** Two pie charts, "Companies’ total share of luxury economic profit, 2023" (77% negative EP development, 23% positive EP development), accompanied by bar charts showing EP development, % point change in EBITA margin, and Revenue growth.
    -   **In non-luxury, value creation will be more evenly distributed across the segment (Page 137):** Premium/bridge, mid-market, value/discount segments dial up value creation, focusing on profitability. Segment "Super Winners" (Inditex, Fast Retailing, TJX) continue EP growth. Other players improving performance. Mall brands (Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Gap) see positive EP impact. Sportswear challengers (Hoka, Salomon) outperform incumbents. Pure online marketplaces see early improvements in EP growth.
        -   **Figure (Page 137):** "EP change, 2023 vs 2024E, top 20 premium/bridge, mid-market and value/discount companies, USD (millions)" bar chart shows value creation distribution, indicating a more even distribution than before.
    -   **Mall brand turnarounds are expected to be one of the EP growth drivers in the non-luxury segment (Page 138):** Surviving mall brands underwent transformations to generate profitability. Top 50 brands by shareholder return include Gap, American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie & Fitch. Gap revamps image under new leadership. American Eagle Outfitters regains momentum with streamlined operations, focus on Millennials. Abercrombie & Fitch targets broader audience, improved quality, inclusive marketing.
        -   **Figure (Page 138):** "Economic profit development and trajectory for select brands, 2012-2023, USD (millions)" line chart shows the EP trajectory for Gap, American Eagle Outfitters, and Abercrombie & Fitch, highlighting recovery and transformation periods.
    -   **The gap between top- and bottom-performing brands is the smallest it has been since 2011 (Page 139):** Bottom performers destroying less value, some becoming value creators. Top performers (luxury) experience EP declines. Top 20% contribution to EP is expected to decrease by 13%points (2022-2024). Bottom 20% contribution expected to increase by 13%points.
        -   **Figure (Page 139):** "Fashion companies’ contribution to industry economic profit by ranked quintile, %" stacked bar chart shows the declining contribution of the Top 20% and increasing contribution of the Bottom 20% to industry EP, leading to a smaller gap.
    -   **However, top-performing companies are still expected to create most of the industry’s value (Page 140):** While the gap is closing, the Top 20% of companies (Super Winners) still contribute 89% of industry EP. The Top 1 company contributes 17%.
        -   **Figure (Page 140):** "Economic profit (EP) power curve, 2024E, USD (millions)" shows a typical power curve distribution, with a small number of companies generating the vast majority of EP.
    -   **Luxury tops the Super Winners list, while sportswear and department stores shift places (Page 141):** 2023 Super Winners list: Luxury players dominate (LVMH). Moncler entered list. Sportswear: Deckers (Hoka parent) debuted, Nike/Lululemon dropped. Department stores: Dillard's dropped, Macy's fell off, El Puerto de Liverpool entered (first Latin American company). Further reshuffling expected in 2024.
        -   **Figure (Page 141):** "Top 20 players by economic profit, 2023, USD (millions)" bar chart lists top companies by EP, indicating new entrants and change in rank.
    -   **L Catterton: Finding Value in a Tough Market (Pages 142-145):** An interview with Nikhil Thukral, Managing Partner at L Catterton.
        -   Thukral discusses L Catterton's investment strategy, focusing on brands with strong profit formulas, clear identity, and pricing power. He notes a shift where luxury consumers increasingly value experiences over products, and China's demand is decreasing. In sportswear, challenger brands succeed by activating "tribes" through cost-efficient digital marketing. He believes the days of high valuations based solely on growth without inherent profit models are over. The focus is now on sustainable profitability. He also observes that all consumer cohorts value experiences and that brands need broader omnichannel strategies, leveraging wholesalers, to build awareness and manage distribution effectively.

## 3. Key Ideas, Claims, and Takeaways

-   **Key Idea 1 – Tumultuous and Uncertain 2025 Outlook:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** The fashion industry is heading into a particularly volatile and unpredictable 2025, characterized by a cyclical slowdown, increased consumer price sensitivity, and significant geopolitical and climate challenges. Growth will be sluggish, and the market dynamics are shifting notably.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This serves as the foundational premise for the entire report, framing all subsequent discussions on challenges, opportunities, and executive priorities. It underscores the need for brands to adapt quickly and differentiate.
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 6), Industry Outlook (Page 9).
    -   **Evidence:** BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 2025 Executive Survey results showing low executive optimism (only 20% expect improvements), and top risks being consumer confidence and geopolitical instability (Page 9). McKinsey Global Fashion Index forecasts low single-digit revenue growth (Page 6).

-   **Key Idea 2 – Non-Luxury to Drive Economic Profit:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** For the first time since 2010 (excluding Covid-19), the non-luxury segment is projected to drive the entirety of the increase in economic profit for the fashion industry in 2024, catching up to and surpassing luxury in value creation.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This represents a historic shift in industry dynamics, challenging the long-held dominance of luxury in value creation. It forces a re-evaluation of strategies for both luxury (facing margin pressure) and non-luxury (benefiting from efficient operations and consumer downtrading).
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 6), McKinsey Global Fashion Index (Page 130, 133).
    -   **Evidence:** McKinsey Global Fashion Index forecasts and analysis showing non-luxury's increased contribution to EP (Page 130, Figure on Page 133). Analysis of consumer downtrading behaviors (Page 134).

-   **Key Idea 3 – Shift from Price to Volume Growth:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** Fashion executives anticipate that volume, rather than price increases, will be the primary driver of modest growth in 2025, reflecting consumer fatigue with high prices and increased price sensitivity.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This highlights a critical strategic pivot for brands, moving away from relying on pricing power to focusing on attracting and retaining customers through other means, such as value, differentiation, and enhanced experiences.
    -   **Where it appears:** Industry Outlook (Page 12), Executive Summary (Page 6).
    -   **Evidence:** BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 2025 Executive Survey data showing a 17 percentage point drop in executives expecting price increases, and nearly two-thirds expecting low single-digit volume growth (Figure on Page 12). Consumer sentiment around high inflation (Page 6).

-   **Key Idea 4 – Rise of the "Silver Generation" as Key Consumers:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** The demographic cohort aged 50 and older ("Silver Generation") is a growing and disproportionately wealthy consumer group that will drive a significant portion of incremental global fashion spending in 2025, yet they are often overlooked by brands.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This identifies a crucial untapped market opportunity, urging brands to rethink traditional youth-focused marketing and product strategies to cater to the specific preferences (functionality, value, individual style) and shopping behaviors of older customers.
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 7), Theme 04: Silver Spenders (Pages 49-54).
    -   **Evidence:** Data showing 50+ consumers driving 48% of incremental global spending in 2025, and 55+ in the US accounting for 72% of wealth (Page 49, 52). Figures illustrating population by age cohort and incremental consumer spending by age (Page 51, 52). Survey data on fashion preferences of Silver Generation consumers (Page 53).

-   **Key Idea 5 – AI-Powered Curation and Search Reinventing Product Discovery:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** Fashion shoppers are overwhelmed by excessive choice online, and generative AI is emerging as a critical tool to revolutionize product discovery, offering hyper-personalized curation and search experiences.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This points to a major technological and customer experience transformation. Brands and retailers must invest in AI foundations and prioritize AI-driven solutions to improve engagement, conversion rates, and meet consumer demand for efficient, tailored shopping journeys.
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 7), Theme 03: Discovery Reinvented (Pages 40-47).
    -   **Evidence:** 74% of customers abandoning purchases due to choice paralysis and 80% dissatisfied with online search (Page 41). 50% of fashion executives see product discovery as key AI use case (Page 40). Examples of AI implementation by Zalando, Alibaba, Daydream, Constructor (Pages 43-45).

-   **Key Idea 6 – Intensifying Competition in Sportswear Driven by Challengers:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** The sportswear market is experiencing an intensifying "showdown," with fast-growing challenger brands (e.g., Hoka, On) poised to generate the majority of economic profit in 2024, outperforming traditional incumbents (e.g., Nike, Puma).
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This highlights a dynamic segment with significant growth potential but also fierce competition. Incumbents need to innovate and adapt their strategies regarding product, marketing, and distribution to counter the challengers' success in targeting niches and leveraging cultural marketing.
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 7), Theme 08: Sportswear Showdown (Pages 100-108).
    -   **Evidence:** Challenger brands expected to make up 57% of sportswear EP in 2024 (Page 100, 101). Divergent stock performance of challengers vs incumbents (Figure on Page 104). Examples of challenger brand strategies (Page 102).

-   **Key Idea 7 – The Imperative for End-to-End Supply Chain Collaboration and Inventory Excellence:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** The fashion industry faces significant challenges with excess stock and stock-outs, exacerbated by rapid trend cycles, unpredictable seasonality, and complex supply chains. Achieving profitability and meeting new sustainability regulations (e.g., EU ban on destroying unsold products) necessitates end-to-end collaboration and tech-enabled inventory management.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This emphasizes that efficient and sustainable inventory management is no longer just an operational concern but a strategic imperative tied to profitability, compliance, and environmental responsibility. It calls for breaking down silos, adopting data-driven tools, and fostering collaboration across the entire value chain.
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 7), Theme 09: Inventory Excellence (Pages 114-120).
    -   **Evidence:** Estimates of 2.5-5B items of excess stock in 2023, causing $70-140B in sales loss (Page 114). Regulation requiring reporting/banning destruction of unsold products (Page 114). Executive priorities for data-driven planning and collaboration (Page 118, 119).

-   **Key Idea 8 – Sustainability as a Collective, Cost-Effective Imperative:**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** Despite brands deprioritizing sustainability and consumer reluctance to pay extra, the climate crisis and mounting regulatory pressures (e.g., $1 trillion required investment for decarbonisation) make inaction on sustainability no longer an option. The industry must act collectively and focus on cost-effective decarbonisation initiatives.
    -   **Why it matters in the context of the document:** This frames sustainability not just as a moral obligation but as an economic necessity for long-term viability. It shifts the focus from individual brand efforts to broader ecosystem collaboration, emphasizing that many decarbonisation levers can be cost-neutral or even cost-saving.
    -   **Where it appears:** Executive Summary (Page 7), Theme 10: The Sustainability Collective (Pages 122-128).
    -   **Evidence:** 63% of brands behind 2030 decarbonisation goals, only 18% executives see sustainability as top risk (Page 122). Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) showing cost-effective decarbonisation opportunities (Figure on Page 125). Examples of collective brand-supplier initiatives (Page 126).

## 7. Constraints, Limitations, and Open Questions

-   **Stated Limitations:**
    -   **Data Volatility for China:** Estimates for China's macroeconomic context as of end of October 2024 are "highly volatile" (Page 10, Note). This implies that projections for China's market growth may carry higher uncertainty.
    -   **General Difficulty of Prediction:** The report acknowledges that "Though hard to predict even in the best of times, the fashion industry is in for a particularly tumultuous and uncertain 2025" (Page 6). This sets a general caveat for all forecasts.
    -   **Scope of MGFI:** The McKinsey Global Fashion Index uses data from 400 public companies (Page 131), and some analyses specify "H1 actuals (for 65 percent of companies) and H2 analyst consensus" (e.g., Page 10, Note; Page 132, Note). This means the index doesn't cover the entire industry.
    -   **Trade-off in Search Monetisation:** Retailers may need to make trade-offs between showing the most relevant products to improve conversion and monetizing search results through sponsored listings (Page 47). This highlights a potential business conflict or limitation in AI implementation.
    -   **Sustainability "Business Case":** "Shoppers have proven less willing than hoped to pay extra for planet-friendly products, making the business case for sustainability less obvious to executives among other competing priorities" (Page 7). This points to a limitation in driving sustainability purely through consumer demand.

-   **Assumptions or conditions under which results hold:**
    -   **Economic Profit (EP) Calculation:** EP is defined as currency-adjusted Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes (NOPLAT) minus capital charge (WACC, multiplied by invested capital) (Page 146). The results depend on this specific calculation methodology.
    -   **Trade Diversification for Resilience:** The report assumes that diversifying sourcing footprints and nearshoring will "create supply chain resilience" (Page 19) and lead to benefits like "faster lead times, higher net margins and lower inventory levels" (Page 22).
    -   **AI Accuracy for Scaling:** The executive priority for AI deployment is to "Prioritise use cases with the highest value, applying a test-and-learn approach to consistently deliver accurate results and enhance customer experience before scaling" (Page 40). This assumes accurate results are a prerequisite for widespread adoption.
    -   **Sustainability Targets:** The MACC curve (Page 125) assumes certain abatement potentials and costs for various sustainability levers.

-   **Open problems or future work:**
    -   **Sufficiency of Government Measures in China:** It remains "uncertain whether government measures will be sufficient to drive a meaningful boost in sentiment in 2025" in China (Page 11).
    -   **Trajectory of Yen and Bank of Japan Policy:** Japan's inbound tourism growth "will rely on the trajectory of the yen and the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy" (Page 33). This is an external factor with ongoing uncertainty.
    -   **Unlocking Marketable Sustainability:** "The industry has yet to unlock a marketable, at-scale value proposition for sustainable fashion" (Page 123). This is an ongoing challenge.
    -   **Measuring Store Contribution to Digital Sales:** As of 2021, only 31% of businesses measured the contribution of stores to digital sales, and vice versa (Page 79). This indicates a gap in analytics that needs addressing for omnichannel success.
