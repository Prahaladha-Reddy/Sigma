## 2. Detailed Section-by-Section Summary

-   **Title Page** (Page 1)
    -   This page presents the full title of the master's thesis: "Exploring the Impact of Psychedelic Art and its Implication in the Field of Medicine and Health: A Pilot Trial." It identifies Mary L. Peng as the author and states the submission is in partial fulfillment of a Master of Public Health degree from the Yale School of Public Health, awarded in May 2023. The primary and secondary thesis advisors, Joan Monin, PhD, and Terika McCall, PhD, are also listed.

-   **Abstract** (Page 2)
    -   **Objectives:** The study aimed to examine how viewing digitally rendered psychedelic art (PA) affects emotional, mental, and physical states in young adults (experimental group) compared to natural scenery (SC, control group). It defines PA as art with bright colors, distorted forms, and intricate patterns, inspired by psychedelic drug visuals but not necessarily involving drug ingestion.
    -   **Method:** A randomized controlled trial with a convergent mixed-methods design was used. 102 participants (PA n=50, SC n=52) aged 18-35 were randomly assigned. Quantitative biometric data (heart rate, galvanic skin conductance (GSC), eye fixation points) were collected while participants viewed a 300-second video. A post-video survey gathered quantitative self-reported data on impact ratings, visual appeal, memory, and qualitative data from open-ended questions on embodied experiences.
    -   **Results:** Baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between groups. Both groups showed significant emotional arousal (increased GSC). Quantitatively, PA had an overall more calming effect than SC, but SC reported higher average sensations of relaxation and reduced stress. Qualitatively, PA induced a greater intensity and diversity of emotional, mental, and physical sensations, including unique experiences like joy, thrill, euphoria, awe, wonder, hypnotizing, meditative effects, wandering thoughts, hyperawareness, and transitions from negative to calm states.
    -   **Conclusion:** The preliminary findings suggest PA is a rich and complex visual art with potential for healing, well-being, and mental health, presenting promising avenues for integration into various healthcare fields.

    -   Lists the main sections of the thesis and their corresponding page numbers, providing an organizational overview of the document.

-   **Introduction** (Page 5)
    -   **Definition of Psychedelic Art:** Begins by defining psychedelic art traditionally as visuals induced by LSD-type drugs in the 1960s, then expands to a contemporary definition encompassing any art depicting "mind manifestation" or the "inner world of the human psyche" without necessarily involving substance use. Key characteristics include kaleidoscopic patterns, distorted/surreal visuals, bright colors, and abstract motion.
    -   **Art and Health Context:** Reviews existing research on the positive impact of artistic engagement on health outcomes, such as reduced stress, anxiety, depression, improved well-being, and physiological symptoms across diverse populations (e.g., cancer, trauma, chronic illnesses).
    -   **Research Gap:** Identifies a gap in current literature regarding the systematic examination of how viewing psychedelic art specifically affects physiological and mental states, despite popular discussions on its use for relaxation and mental clarity.
    -   **Study Objective:** States the study's aim to address this gap by systematically measuring quantitative biomarkers and qualitative feedback in response to digitally rendered psychedelic art. It highlights the potential for digital art to offer immersive, multimodal interventions without substance use, applicable to wellness products and art therapies.
    -   **Study Design:** Confirms the use of a randomized pilot trial with a convergent mixed-methods design to empirically explore PA's distinct impact compared to a control group.

-   **Methods - General Design and Recruitment** (Page 6)
    -   **Study Design:** Describes the study as a randomized pilot trial utilizing a convergent mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data.
    -   **Data Collection Environment:** Conducted in the Consumer Health Informatics Lab at Yale Center for Medical Informatics, ensuring privacy with controlled temperature and lighting.
    -   **Participants:** Recruited students, staff, faculty, and affiliated members across Yale University.
    -   **Eligibility Criteria:** Participants had to be between 18 and 35 years old and proficient in English.
    -   **Exclusion Criteria:** Severe visual impairment/blindness or clinically diagnosed/self-identified cognitive impairment, to minimize confounding effects on visual and emotional responses.
    -   **Enrollment:** Of 110 initial sign-ups, 1 failed screening, 5 dropped before randomization. 104 were randomized. 2 PA participants dropped due to injury/sickness, resulting in final groups of PA (n=50) and SC (n=52). This process is detailed in Figure 1 (CONSORT diagram).

-   **Methods - Data Collection and Measures** (Pages 7-8)
    -   **Intervention:** Participants viewed a 300-second (5-minute) video corresponding to their assigned group (PA or SC).
    -   **Physiological Data Collection:** During video viewing, heart rate (HR), galvanic skin conductance (GSC), and eye movement patterns (fixation points) were collected using a GP3 Eye Tracking and Biometric Tracking Device (Figure 2).
    -   **Post-Video Assessment:** Each participant completed a survey.
    -   **Potential Covariates:** An electronically administered demographic survey collected pre-intervention data on age, gender, race, recent stress level (5-point Likert scale), sleep duration and quality (5-point Likert scale), and decision-making type (logic- vs. emotion-driven, with definitions provided). Mental health conditions were also recorded.
    -   **Physiological Outcomes:** HR variability was used as an indicator of relaxation and stress. GSC was used as an indirect measure of emotional intensity and attention, associated with sympathetic autonomic activity. Eye fixation points were used to understand visual focal areas.
    -   **Mental Process Outcomes:** After the video, participants were shown 12 images from the video (Figure 3) and asked to identify if they remembered seeing them (visual recall frequency) and rate their visual appeal (1-5 scale). This aimed to explore differential interactions between abstract/representational stimuli and memory/affectional mechanisms.

-   **Methods - Self-reported Psychosomatic Outcomes and Data Analysis** (Page 10)
    -   **Self-reported Psychosomatic Outcomes:** A 5-item Likert Scale (1="not at all" to 5="very much so") assessed the extent to which the video induced relaxation, calmness, happiness, reduced stress, and somnolence. Open-ended questions gathered detailed qualitative descriptions of physical, emotional, and mental states.
    -   **Quantitative Analysis:** Excel was used for descriptive statistics of demographics. GSC, HR, and fixation points data were analyzed. GSC and HR variability were calculated at 150-second intervals. Paired t-tests compared GSC/HR within groups (baseline to midpoint, midpoint to endpoint, baseline to endpoint). Unpaired 2-sample t-tests compared GSC/HR variabilities and Likert scale responses between PA and SC groups.
    -   **Qualitative Analysis:** Researcher MP inductively coded all open-ended responses using Excel, identifying distinct themes related to emotional, mental, and physical responses.

-   **Ethics** (Page 10)
    -   The study was approved by the Yale University Institutional Review Board (ID #2000033683). All subjects provided informed consent. No adverse events (physical or mental symptoms requiring clinical attention) occurred. The study adhered to the 1964 Helsinki Declaration. Participants received $10 Amazon gift cards.

-   **Results - Demographic Information** (Page 11)
    -   **Study Population:** 102 young adults (18-35 years old), with 50 in the PA group and 52 in the SC group, exceeding the minimum recommended sample size for pilot trials.
    -   **Comparability:** Table 1 details demographic characteristics, showing high comparability between the PA and SC groups across age (mean 24.6 vs. 24.4), gender distribution (e.g., PA 78% female, SC 73.1% female), recent stress level (mean 3.5 vs. 3.3), sleep duration (mean 7.1 vs. 6.8 hours), sleep quality (mean 3.5 for both), and decision-making type. The distribution of self-reported mental health conditions (0, 1, 2, or 3+ conditions) was also similar, with various conditions like anxiety, ADHD, and depression reported.

-   **Results - Quantitative Results - Indicators of Emotional Arousal** (Page 12)
    -   **Galvanic Skin Conductance (GSC):** Table 2 shows that mean GSC increased from baseline to midpoint and endpoint in both PA and SC groups, indicating emotional arousal.
    -   **Heart Rate (HR):** Mean HR increased slightly from baseline to midpoint and then slightly decreased from midpoint to endpoint in both groups (Table 2).
    -   **Within-Group Significance (Table 3):**
        -   **PA Group:** Significant GSC increases from baseline to midpoint (p<0.001) and baseline to endpoint (p=0.001). No significant HR changes.
        -   **SC Group:** Significant GSC increases from baseline to midpoint (p<0.001) and baseline to endpoint (p<0.001). A significant HR decrease from midpoint to endpoint (p=0.030) was observed.

-   **Results - Quantitative Results - Between-Group Comparisons and Visual Focus** (Page 14)
    -   **Between-Group GSC/HR Differences (Table 4):** Unpaired t-tests showed significant differences in GSC variation between groups:
        -   GSC variation from baseline to midpoint: SC group (50.3%) showed a significantly greater increase than PA group (24.4%) (p=0.011).
        -   GSC variation from baseline to endpoint: SC group (57.9%) showed a significantly greater increase than PA group (28.4%) (p=0.022).
        -   No significant differences in HR variations between groups.
    -   **Indicators of Visual Focus (Table 5 & Figure 4):** The average total fixation points in the PA group (M=505.7) were significantly lower than in the SC group (M=547.2) (p=0.023). This indicates PA participants had more concentrated areas of interest. Heat maps (Figure 4) visually corroborate this, showing a visibly more dispersed focal area in the SC group.

-   **Results - Quantitative Results - Self-reported Psychosomatic Outcomes** (Page 15)
    -   **Likert Scale Responses (Table 6):** Significant differences were found:
        -   **Relaxation:** SC (M=3.7) reported significantly higher relaxation than PA (M=3.1) (p=0.005).
        -   **Calmness:** PA (M=3.1) reported significantly higher calmness than SC (M=3.0) (p<0.001).
        -   **Reduced Stress:** SC (M=3.6) reported significantly greater stress reduction than PA (M=3.1) (p=0.020).
        -   No significant differences for happiness (p=0.057) or somnolence (p=0.613).
    -   Summary: SC was associated with greater relaxation and reduced stress, while PA was associated with a greater calming effect.

-   **Results - Perceived Visual Appeal and Recall Frequency** (Pages 15-16)
    -   **Relationship between Appeal and Recall (Figure 5 & Table 7):**
        -   **PA Group:** Showed an upward-sloped best fit line, indicating a *positive relationship* between perceived visual appeal and memory retention.
        -   **SC Group:** Showed a slightly downward-sloped best fit line, indicating a *slightly negative relationship*.
        -   The PA group's slope was steeper, suggesting a stronger association between appeal and memorability. Although SC images generally had higher appeal scores than PA, this did not correlate with greater memorability in the SC group.

-   **Results - Qualitative Results** (Pages 17-18)
    -   **Overview:** 50 PA and 52 SC detailed descriptions were analyzed, yielding 11 themes for PA and 9 for SC. PA-induced sensations were more intense and diverse (Figure 6, Table 8 provides illustrative quotes).
    -   **Relaxation and peace:** Common in both (PA n=16, SC n=26).
    -   **Excitement, entertainment, joy:** Common in PA (n=16) with intense feelings ("thrill," "euphoria," "audibly gasping," "like I was high," "roller coaster" analogy). Less common and intense in SC (n=8).
    -   **Calming and decompressing effect:** Reported by PA (n=12) as mitigating stress/anxiety by absorbing attention ("didn't hear usual anxious thoughts"). Similar effect in SC (19.2%).
    -   **Sleep-inducing effect:** Reported by PA (n=8) and SC (21.2%).
    -   **Wandering thoughts:** More prominent in PA (n=8), leading to thoughts about the universe, space, and plants. Less common in SC (n=2).
    -   **Semi-trance states:** Unique to PA (n=7), characterized by empty-mindedness, total absorption, and diminished sensory activity.
    -   **Physical energization:** Unique to PA (n=2), body feeling "energized" by constant motion.
    -   **Hyper-awareness of bodily states:** Reported by both (PA n=4, SC n=4), focusing on breathing and heart rate.
    -   **Meditative effect:** Unique to PA (n=3), described as explicitly meditative or inducing mind-body harmony.
    -   **Nostalgia:** Unique to SC (n=8, 15.4%), triggered by natural scenery reminding participants of past memories.
    -   **Neutral experiences:** Reported by both groups (PA n=3, SC n=6), indicating no strong emotional response.
    -   **Negative experiences:** PA (n=5) reported overstimulation, dizziness, or stress, sometimes transitioning from negative to positive. SC (n=5) reported vertigo, boredom, increased stress/anxiety.

-   **Discussion** (Pages 21-23)
    -   **Summary of Findings:** PA significantly affected emotional, mental, and physical states. GSC showed emotional arousal in both groups, but SC showed a greater increase in arousal. PA showed a positive link between visual appeal and memory. PA induced relaxation, calmness, reduced anxiety/stress, and sleep, while being neutral for happiness. Qualitative data highlighted diverse and intense embodied experiences unique to PA.
    -   **Mechanisms of PA Impact:** Attributes PA's unique effects to its abstract/surreal forms challenging reality (evoking wonder), vibrant colors, high contrast stimulating the visual cortex (excitement, pleasure, euphoria), and intricate/repetitive patterns creating order and symmetry (pleasantness, elation). Suggests increased functional connectivity between brain regions from PA viewing, leading to mind-body oneness.
    -   **Abstract vs. Concrete Visual Information:** Explores how concrete (SC) vs. abstract (PA) visuals might differ. SC evoked greater overall emotional arousal (GSC) and self-reported relaxation/stress reduction, but PA evoked greater *calmness*. SC had more dispersed visual focus, while PA had concentrated focus. The distinct relationship between visual appeal and memory (positive for PA, negative for SC) suggests different brain processing pathways for abstract vs. meaning-laden representational (nostalgia-inducing) information. The greater diversity and intensity of PA's psychosomatic responses support the hypothesis that abstract art allows for new emotional/cognitive connections.

-   **Implications for Mental Health** (Page 24)
    -   **Therapeutic Potential:** PA can alleviate anxiety/stress, induce relaxation, calmness, joy, and excitement, serving as a creative and complementary therapeutic tool for psychiatric conditions (anxiety, depression). It can aid introspection and emotional healing.
    -   **Well-being and Mindfulness:** PA can promote transcendence, semi-trance states, and a sense of connection, reducing stress. Its meditative quality makes it suitable for mindfulness practices.
    -   **Sleep Improvement:** PA's sleep-inducing quality suggests its use in bedtime routines, simulating dream-like states, and distracting from negative thoughts for sleep disorders like insomnia.
    -   **Psychedelic Therapy:** Future research should explore PA's therapeutic function in psychedelic therapy settings, similar to music's role in emotional release, helping patients process experiences.

-   **Implication for Digital Health** (Page 25)
    -   **Mobile Mental Health Apps:** PA can be integrated into digital health applications for: mood enhancement (colorful, stimulating images), visual aid for psychedelic therapies (exploring thoughts/emotions), enhancing app aesthetic appeal (engagement, retention), and paying homage to its cultural history.
    -   **Accessibility Challenge:** Notes the "digital divide" where lack of devices, internet, or digital literacy could limit accessibility for certain populations (elderly, those with disabilities, low SES). Calls for governments, health workers, and designers to ensure equitable access.

-   **Integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI)** (Pages 25-26)
    -   **Personalized Therapy:** Since PA impacts vary, AI can create patient-centered interventions. AI algorithms can generate novel, complex patterns to increase engagement and wonder. More advanced AI could tailor PA based on individual preferences, or even real-time biometric data (e.g., electrocardiogram) to induce specific states like relaxation, excitement, or meditative states, requiring further neural activity research.
    -   **Therapist Assistance:** AI can support therapists by generating art, offering inspiration, and automating creation processes.
    -   **Increased Accessibility:** AI-generated PA can be made available online, benefiting those with mobility/financial constraints or in rural areas.
    -   **Healing Environments:** PA can create immersive therapeutic environments in hospitals and healthcare settings through projections, interactive installations, virtual reality, and integration into healing gardens.

-   **Future Medical Research** (Page 27)
    -   **Efficacy and Mechanisms:** Research should investigate PA therapy for specific mental health conditions, its therapeutic mechanisms, target patient populations, and standardized protocols.
    -   **Neural Correlates:** Explore brain regions and networks activated by PA, its potential to induce altered states of consciousness, and its use as a non-invasive harm reduction tool (e.g., by interfering with addiction circuitry).
    -   **Objective Measures:** Develop objective measures for therapeutic outcomes in PA therapy (brain activity, cognitive performance, biomarkers).
    -   **AI Optimization:** Research needed to optimize AI algorithms for generating therapeutically effective PA.
    -   **Implementation Science:** Study best practices for integrating PA into healthcare settings and its effects on patient outcomes.

-   **Limitations** (Pages 27-28)
    -   **Study Design:** Single-blind (researcher blind, but participants not blind due to obvious visual differences between PA and SC). Mitigated by not giving participants prior information or leading directions.
    -   **Generalizability:** Limited by:
        -   Age range (18-35) to control for confounding effects; older demographics need future study.
        -   Unequal racial/gender distribution (predominantly female, Asian/White); American Indian/Alaska Native/Pacific Islanders were not represented.
        -   Limited demographic data (no SES or educational background collected).
        -   Did not account for all existing physical/mental health conditions (e.g., autism, PTSD, Alzheimer's) that might affect visual/emotion processing.
    -   **Unexamined Factors:** Did not assess cognitive abilities like creativity, which is a promising area for future research.
    -   **Setting:** Laboratory setting, not reflective of real-world use. Future studies should explore PA's effects in diverse settings (meditative, spiritual activities).

-   **Conclusion** (Page 29)
    -   Reiterates that the study provides preliminary evidence for PA's wide-ranging emotional, mental, and physical impacts, including unique sensations not observed with natural scenery. These findings, combined with biometric and self-report data, suggest PA's potential to inspire creativity, facilitate healing, and promote well-being. The study emphasizes the limited current research on PA's neural mechanisms and its implications for altered states of consciousness and mental health, highlighting numerous directions for future medical research.

## 3. Key Ideas, Claims, and Takeaways

-   **Key Idea 1 – Psychedelic Art Induces Diverse and Intense Psychosomatic Experiences**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** Viewing digitally rendered psychedelic art (PA) leads to a wider variety and greater intensity of emotional, mental, and physical sensations compared to viewing natural scenery. These unique experiences include semi-trance states, physical energization, meditative effects, thrill, euphoria, and a distinct transition from negative to positive feelings.
    -   **Why it matters:** This finding highlights PA's unique capacity to engage the human psyche beyond simple relaxation, suggesting potential for deeper therapeutic applications, mind exploration, and creative stimulation.
    -   **Where it appears:** Abstract (Page 2), Results (Pages 17-19, Figure 6, Table 8), Discussion (Page 21), Conclusion (Page 29).
    -   **Evidence:** Qualitative analysis of open-ended participant descriptions identified 11 themes for PA, with several being unique to PA (e.g., semi-trance state, meditative effect, physically energizing, thrill/euphoria/elation, temporary overstimulation/dizziness, transition from negative to positive). Illustrative participant quotes are provided in Table 8.

-   **Key Idea 2 – Differential Impact on Relaxation, Calmness, and Stress Reduction**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** While natural scenery (SC) significantly induces greater sensations of relaxation and reduced stress, psychedelic art (PA) leads to an overall greater *calming effect*, defined as the ability to mitigate initial or emerging feelings of anxiety and stress.
    -   **Why it matters:** This distinction is crucial for targeted therapeutic interventions. If the goal is passive relaxation, natural scenery might be more effective. If the goal is active alleviation of distress, PA might be more suited due to its absorbing nature.
    -   **Where it appears:** Abstract (Page 2), Results (Page 15, Table 6), Discussion (Page 23), Conclusion (Page 29).
    -   **Evidence:** Self-reported Likert scale data (Table 6) shows SC significantly higher for "Relaxation" (p=0.005) and "Reduced stress" (p=0.020), but PA significantly higher for "Calmness" (p<0.001). Qualitative data (Page 17, Table 8) supports that PA's calming effect often stemmed from its ability to absorb attention and distract from anxious thoughts.

-   **Key Idea 3 – Psychedelic Art Enhances the Link Between Visual Appeal and Memory**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** For psychedelic art, there is a positive relationship between how visually appealing an image is perceived and how well it is remembered. In contrast, for natural scenery, this relationship is slightly negative or non-existent, despite natural scenery often being rated as more appealing overall.
    -   **Why it matters:** This suggests that abstract psychedelic visuals engage memory mechanisms differently than concrete natural images. It could imply that PA creates novel associations or activates hard-to-access inner states, which are intrinsically tied to its aesthetic experience and memorability.
    -   **Where it appears:** Results (Pages 15-16, Figure 5, Table 7), Discussion (Page 22, 23), Conclusion (Page 29).
    -   **Evidence:** The scatter plot (Figure 5) and associated data (Table 7) show an upward-sloped best-fit line for PA, indicating a positive correlation between appeal and recall, while SC shows a downward-sloped line. The discussion (Page 23) elaborates that SC's memory retention might rely on previously established information-emotion associations, unlike PA.

-   **Key Idea 4 – Potential for Psychedelic Art in Mental Health, Digital Health, and AI-driven Therapy**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** Psychedelic art holds significant promise for integration into various health domains, including psychotherapy, digital mental health applications, and AI-powered therapeutic interventions. It can serve as a tool for mood enhancement, stress reduction, sleep improvement, and a visual aid in psychedelic therapy. AI could personalize PA experiences, assist therapists, and increase accessibility.
    -   **Why it matters:** This broad application scope positions PA as an innovative, non-pharmacological tool to promote well-being, address mental health conditions, and enhance therapeutic processes in an increasingly digital world.
    -   **Where it appears:** Conclusion (Page 2), Implications for mental health (Page 24), Implication for digital health (Page 25), Integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Pages 25-26), Future medical research (Page 27), Conclusion (Page 29).
    -   **Evidence:** The entire Discussion and Implications sections are dedicated to this, drawing directly from the study's quantitative and qualitative findings of PA's diverse impacts. Specific examples include using PA for mindfulness, as a distraction for insomnia, for creating healing environments, and for AI to generate tailored content based on user responses or biometric data.

-   **Key Idea 5 – Brain Response to Abstract vs. Concrete Visuals**
    -   **What the idea/claim is:** The human brain likely processes abstract, unfamiliar visual information (psychedelic art) differently from concrete, familiar, meaning-laden information (natural scenery), leading to distinct emotional and physiological responses. The SC group showed greater overall emotional arousal (GSC increase) but more dispersed visual focus, while the PA group had more concentrated focus and unique internal states.
    -   **Why it matters:** This highlights fundamental differences in cognitive and emotional processing pathways depending on the nature of visual stimuli. Understanding these differences can inform more precise applications of visual art in therapy and wellness.
    -   **Where it appears:** Discussion (Pages 21-23), Results (Page 14, Table 4, Table 5, Figure 4).
    -   **Evidence:** Quantitative results show SC had a significantly greater increase in GSC (emotional arousal) from baseline to endpoint (Table 4) and more dispersed eye fixation points (Table 5, Figure 4). PA, while inducing less overall GSC arousal, led to more concentrated visual focus and triggered unique qualitative experiences (semi-trance, meditative) not seen with SC. The discussion postulates that abstract art may reduce the predominant impact of familiar reality, allowing new connections within the brain.

## 4. Important Tables (with page numbers)

-   **Table ID:** Table 1
-   **Page:** 11
-   **Title/Caption:** Demographic characteristics of study participants
-   **What it shows (content):** This table provides a detailed breakdown of participant demographics and baseline characteristics for the total sample (n=102), the experimental Psychedelic Art (PA) group (n=50), and the control Scenery (SC) group (n=52). It includes age (mean and SD), gender distribution (n and %), racial distribution (n and %), recent stress level (mean and SD), hours of sleep the night before the experiment (mean and SD), quality of sleep (mean and SD), decision-making type (emotion-driven vs. logic-driven, n and %), mental health state (number of conditions, n and %), and specific diagnosed mental health conditions (n and %).
-   **Why it is important:** This table is critical for establishing the comparability of the experimental and control groups at baseline, reinforcing the validity of the randomized control trial design. It demonstrates that any observed differences in outcomes are likely attributable to the intervention (viewing PA vs. SC) rather than pre-existing demographic or health disparities. It directly supports the "Results - Demographic Information" section and underpins the reliability of subsequent quantitative and qualitative analyses.

-   **Table ID:** Table 3
-   **Page:** 13
-   **Title/Caption:** Paired 2 sample t-test on the mean differences in GSC and HR from midpoint to baseline, endpoint to midpoint, and endpoint to baseline within the experimental group and the control group
-   **What it shows (content):** This table presents the mean differences and p-values from paired t-tests for Galvanic Skin Conductance (GSC) and Heart Rate (HR) within each group (PA and SC) across three intervals: midpoint-baseline, endpoint-midpoint, and endpoint-baseline. For the PA group, GSC increased significantly from baseline to midpoint (p=0.000) and baseline to endpoint (p=0.001). For the SC group, GSC also increased significantly for these same intervals (both p=0.000). The SC group additionally showed a significant decrease in HR from midpoint to endpoint (p=0.030).
-   **Why it is important:** This table provides direct quantitative evidence of physiological changes (emotional arousal via GSC, and subtle heart rate changes) occurring *during* the video viewing experience for both types of visual stimuli. It supports the abstract's claim about significant emotional arousal and helps differentiate the physiological impact of each video type, linking directly to the "Indicators of emotional arousal" section in the results.

-   **Table ID:** Table 4
-   **Page:** 14
-   **Title/Caption:** Unpaired 2 sample t-test results comparing midpoint-baseline, endpoint-midpoint, and endpoint-baseline GSC and HR variations between experimental and control groups
-   **What it shows (content):** This table compares the percentage variation in GSC and HR between the PA and SC groups across the same three intervals as Table 3 (midpoint-baseline, endpoint-midpoint, endpoint-baseline). It shows that GSC variation from baseline to midpoint (p=0.011) and from baseline to endpoint (p=0.022) were significantly *greater* in the SC group compared to the PA group (e.g., 50.3% vs 24.4% increase from baseline to midpoint). There were no statistically significant differences in HR variations between the two groups.
-   **Why it is important:** This table is crucial for comparing the *magnitude* of physiological arousal between the PA and SC groups. It reveals that natural scenery induced a significantly greater overall increase in GSC (emotional arousal) than psychedelic art, despite PA leading to more diverse qualitative experiences. This nuance is vital for understanding the distinct effects of each visual type and supports Key Idea 5 regarding differential brain responses.

-   **Table ID:** Table 5
-   **Page:** 14
-   **Title/Caption:** Unpaired 2-sample t-test comparing fixation points between the experimental group and the control group
-   **What it shows (content):** This table presents the mean and standard deviation of total fixation points for the PA group (M=505.7, SD=97.7) and the SC group (M=547.2, SD=83.1). The unpaired t-test shows a statistically significant difference (p=0.023), with the PA group having significantly fewer fixation points than the SC group.

## 8. Notes for the Storytelling / Presentation Agent

-   **Key Ideas to Emphasize:**
    -   **For a technical audience:** Emphasize Key Idea 1 (diverse/intense psychosomatic experiences), Key Idea 2 (nuanced impact on relaxation/calmness vs. stress reduction), Key Idea 3 (appeal-memory link for abstract art), and Key Idea 5 (differential brain response to abstract vs. concrete visuals) backed by specific biometric data (GSC, fixation points) and the distinct qualitative themes. Highlight the methodological rigor of the mixed-methods approach and the calls for future neural correlate research.
    -   **For a non-technical audience:** Emphasize Key Idea 1 (the unique and powerful experiences PA can induce, like joy, awe, and meditative states), and Key Idea 4 (the broad potential for PA in mental health, wellness apps, and even AI-personalized therapy). Focus on the *benefits* and *novelty* of PA as a non-pharmacological tool for well-being, while briefly acknowledging the pilot nature and need for further research.

-   **Best candidates to embed in a story or slide deck:**
    -   **Figure 6 (Page 20) - Themes of open-ended descriptions:** Excellent for illustrating the *diversity and intensity* of PA's impacts qualitatively, visually differentiating PA's unique experiences from SC's. Good for a high-level overview or detailed drill-down into participant experiences. Can be used early to establish the "what" of PA's impact.
    -   **Figure 5 (Page 16) - Scatter plot of visual recall frequency against visual appeal score:** Powerful visual to demonstrate a key cognitive difference (Key Idea 3). It's engaging and clearly shows the contrasting relationships for PA vs. SC, good for explaining how PA works differently.
    -   **Table 6 (Page 15) - Unpaired 2-sample t-test comparing the impact of the video-viewing experience:** Directly quantifies the self-reported emotional impacts (Key Idea 2). Can be simplified for a non-technical audience to show "PA is more calming, SC is more relaxing." For technical, the p-values are key.
    -   **Figure 4 (Page 15) - Heat maps:** Visually compelling for illustrating differences in visual attention (Key Idea 5). Can show "PA draws more focused attention" vs. SC.
    -   **Table 4 (Page 14) - Unpaired 2 sample t-test results comparing GSC...between groups:** Important for a technical audience to show quantitative physiological differences (SC had greater *overall arousal* than PA, a nuanced but critical point). Might be too detailed for a quick non-technical presentation.

-   **Natural narrative arcs:**
    1.  **Problem/Gap:** Art is therapeutic, but PA is unexplored (Introduction, Page 5).
    2.  **Method:** How we studied it (RCT, mixed-methods, biometrics) (Methods, Pages 6-10).
    3.  **Results (Core Findings):** PA induces diverse, intense, unique experiences (qualitative), and different appeal-memory dynamics (quantitative), with distinct calming/relaxing effects (Results, Pages 11-19).
    4.  **Implications/Future:** Why this matters for mental health, digital health, and AI (Discussion, Pages 21-26, Implications, Page 27).
    5.  **Conclusion/Next Steps:** Summary and call for more research (Conclusion, Page 29, Limitations, Pages 27-28).

-   **Sections that can be downplayed or skipped in a high-level story:**
    -   Detailed methodological minutiae (e.g., specific IRB ID numbers, minor exclusions from randomization if not impacting overall sample balance).
    -   Extensive bibliography (can be summarized as "well-referenced").
    -   Raw numerical data in Table 1 (demographics) can be summarized as "groups were comparable at baseline."
    -   The full breakdown of every single mental health condition reported in Table 1.
    -   The detailed calculations of GSC/HR variability unless specifically focusing on the physiological metrics.
