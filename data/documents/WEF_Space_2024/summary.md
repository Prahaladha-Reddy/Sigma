-   **Role in the document:** It's one of the two core components used to segment and analyze the space economy. The report details its current size, projected growth, and specific sub-segments (commercial and state-sponsored).

-   **Term:** Space "Reach"
-   **Page(s):** 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, and in appendix figures
-   **Explanation:** Describes the revenues generated by companies in non-space industries that are enabled or significantly enhanced by space technologies. These are applications where space-based data or services are integral to a product or service's functionality and scale, even if the end-user doesn't directly interact with space hardware (e.g., ride-hailing, precision agriculture, supply chain visibility).
-   **Role in the document:** It's the other core component of the space economy, and the report highlights its faster growth rate compared to the "backbone," indicating a broadening impact of space technologies on terrestrial industries.

-   **Term:** PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing)
-   **Page(s):** 7, 9, 13, 18, 19, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, and in appendix figures
-   **Explanation:** Refers to technologies that provide precise location, guidance, and synchronization information, primarily delivered by satellite systems like GPS.
-   **Role in the document:** PNT is identified as a key driver of the space economy's "reach," enabling numerous applications in mobility, logistics, financial systems, and defense. Its ubiquity and crucial role in many industries are emphasized.

-   **Term:** Earth Observation (EO)
-   **Page(s):** 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, and in appendix figures
-   **Explanation:** The use of satellite-based systems to collect and analyze data about Earth's physical, chemical, and biological systems. This includes imagery, environmental data, and climate monitoring.
-   **Role in the document:** EO is highlighted as another significant enabler within both the "backbone" (commercial operators providing data) and "reach" (industries leveraging EO data for decision-making, climate mitigation, disaster response).

-   **Term:** In-orbit servicing
-   **Page(s):** 4, 14, 15
-   **Explanation:** Services performed on satellites or spacecraft while they are in orbit, including inspection, maintenance, repair, refueling, upgrading, life extension, and active debris removal.
-   **Role in the document:** Identified as a "feature of the future" that will significantly boost the space economy by reducing costs, extending asset lifespans, and fostering a circular space economy.

-   **Term:** Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Broadband
-   **Page(s):** 7, 12, 32, 34, 39, 45, 46
-   **Explanation:** Internet connectivity services provided by constellations of satellites operating in Low Earth Orbit, offering lower latency and wider coverage than traditional geostationary satellites.
-   **Role in the document:** Presented as a rapidly growing segment of commercial communications, vital for bridging digital divides in remote areas and enabling various "reach" applications. It's used in FIGURE 1 to compare its adoption curve to other transformative technologies.

## 7. Constraints, Limitations, and Open Questions

-   **Stated limitations:**
    -   **Geopolitical factors:** The report explicitly states that geopolitical factors could have an outsized impact on the space economy, but quantifying these implications lies beyond the scope of this report due to their geopolitical nature and high variability on a global scale (e.g., allocation of public investments and national policy modifications). (Page 23, Section 2)
    -   **Non-revenue-based value:** The report notes that non-revenue-based value creation (e.g., improved cost performance, risk mitigation from PNT services, or cost efficiencies from EO) has not been included in the economic estimations. (Page 18, Section 1; Page 19, Section 1)
    -   **Specific industry exclusions:** The chemicals and materials industry is not represented in the detailed industry sizing as no identified use cases were found. (Page 47, FIGURE 19 footnote)
    -   **Unintended outcomes:** The report mentions "unknown" risks (e.g., growth in space activity having unintended impacts on atmospherics) that have not been explored in depth. (Page 25, Section 2)

-   **Assumptions or conditions under which results hold:**
    -   **Inflation:** All numbers are in constant US dollars, with inflation estimated at +3% per annum (p.a.) on average for 2023-35. (Page 9, Section 1)
    -   **Global GDP growth:** Global nominal GDP growth is forecasted to grow at +5% p.a. over 2023-35, used as a reference point for space economy growth comparisons. (Page 9, Section 1; Page 23, FIGURE 9 footnote)
    -   **State-sponsored budgets:** Forecasts are derived from committed budgets and extrapolated based on countries' space priorities, assuming a relatively stable geopolitical environment without considering major conflicts that could reallocate governmental spending. (Page 44, Appendix - State-sponsored Civil; Page 38, Appendix - State-sponsored Defence)
    -   **Space tourism accommodation:** The base case assumes accommodation capacity remains a constraint by 2035, limiting growth. (Page 16, Section 1)
    -   **Direct-to-device connectivity:** Assumed to plateau after initial heavy growth due to low data throughput and high costs compared to terrestrial alternatives, mainly serving text messages/phone calls in remote areas. (Page 12, Section 1; Page 46, Appendix - Digital Communications)

-   **Warnings or caveats:**
    -   **PNT reliance:** PNT capabilities were primarily built for military purposes; dual mission and reliance on a single system create risks for consumers and businesses in case of malfunction. Diversification and redundancy are crucial. (Page 13, Section 1)
    -   **Unintended consequences of space activity:** Proliferation of space activity could lead to more debris, overcrowding of orbits, light pollution affecting astronomers, and potential geopolitical conflict escalation. Careful consideration, collaboration, and management are essential. (Page 25, Section 2; Feature of the Future on page 24)
    -   **Disclaimer:** The document is published as a contribution to a project and its findings, interpretations, and conclusions do not necessarily represent the views of the World Economic Forum or its Members, Partners, or other stakeholders. (Page 2, Disclaimer)

## 8. Notes for the Storytelling / Presentation Agent

-   **Which Key Ideas should be emphasized for:**
    -   **A technical audience:**
        -   **Key Idea 2 – Space Economy: Backbone vs. Reach:** Emphasize the detailed breakdown of services within each, growth drivers like decreased launch costs, commercial innovation, and the technical aspects of PNT and EO applications across industries. Discuss the technical challenges and opportunities in areas like in-orbit servicing, super-heavy launchers, and direct-to-device connectivity.
        -   **Key Idea 5 – Drivers and Trajectory Scenarios:** Focus on the underlying technological advancements and financial competitiveness that shape the upside/downside scenarios, including discussions on data harmonization, cost curve improvements, and the specific technological hurdles for reaching the upper bound. Also, highlight the "Constraints, Limitations, and Open Questions" related to debris and orbit management.
    -   **A non-technical audience:**
        -   **Key Idea 1 – Exponential Growth of the Space Economy:** Start with the striking $1.8 trillion figure and the comparison to GDP growth, making it immediately impactful.
        -   **Key Idea 3 – Space as a Solution to Global Challenges:** This is highly relatable and demonstrates direct societal benefit. Use concrete examples like disaster mitigation (wildfires, methane leaks), humanitarian aid, and bridging digital divides.
        -   **Key Idea 4 – Diverse Industry Impact and New Ventures:** Focus on how space touches everyday life (e.g., food delivery, mobile phones, ride-hailing) and exciting new areas like space tourism.

-   **Which tables and figures are the BEST candidates to embed in a story or slide deck:**
    -   **FIGURE 1 (page 7):** Excellent for an opening slide to show the "inflection point" analogy, comparing LEO broadband to historical technologies like the internet. Visually compelling and easy to grasp.
    -   **FIGURE 2 (page 9):** Essential for showing the main economic growth projections (Total, Backbone, Reach) and their CAGRs. This is the core data for the "exponential growth" narrative. Could be an early slide to establish scale.
    -   **FIGURE 10 (page 27):** Perfect for illustrating the "space for global challenges" narrative. The three icons and their brief descriptions clearly convey the non-financial benefits. Use this when discussing societal impact.
    -   **FIGURE 8 (page 20):** Good for a high-level overview of industry impact. Visually shows the breadth of influence without getting bogged down in too much detail initially. Could be used after introducing the total economic size.
    -   **FIGURE 9 (page 23):** Valuable for a slightly more nuanced discussion on the future, showing the range of potential outcomes and discussing the factors influencing them. Use this to introduce strategic considerations and risks.
    -   **TABLE 1 (page 32):** Useful for a concluding slide, outlining clear calls to action for different stakeholders. It summarizes the report's recommendations effectively.

-   **Any natural narrative arcs:**
    -   **Problem → Opportunity → Solution → Call to Action:**
        1.  **Problem (implicit):** Global challenges, economic growth needs, untapped potential.
        2.  **Opportunity:** The space economy is at an inflection point, poised for massive growth ($1.8T by 2035) and impacting diverse industries (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 8).
        3.  **Solution:** Space technologies provide solutions for economic growth (Backbone & Reach), and for global challenges (disaster mitigation, prosperity, humanitarian response) (Key Idea 3, FIGURE 10).
        4.  **Call to Action:** What stakeholders need to do (standardization, collaboration, investment, policy) to realize this potential (TABLE 1).
    -   **Current State → Future Trajectory → Strategic Imperatives:**
        1.  **Current State:** Space economy is $630B, divided into Backbone and Reach.
        2.  **Future Trajectory:** Projected growth to $1.8T, with Upside/Downside scenarios and key drivers/inhibitors (FIGURE 9).
        3.  **Strategic Imperatives:** Recommendations for different stakeholders to shape the future positively (TABLE 1).

-   **Any sections that can probably be downplayed or skipped in a high-level story:**
    -   The very detailed deep-dives in the Appendix (pages 34-46) for individual industries, while important for a comprehensive understanding, might be too granular for a high-level executive summary or short presentation. Instead, selectively choose key insights or specific industry examples from them.
    -   The "Contributors" and "Endnotes" sections can typically be relegated to an appendix or skipped in a high-level narrative, although acknowledging the partnership and expert contributions (from foreword) is important for credibility.
    -   Some of the very specific sub-segmentation within figures (e.g., the minute breakdown of commercial communications in FIGURE 5) can be simplified for a high-level audience to focus on the overall trends (e.g., satellite TV declining, broadband growing).
