# Autonomous Vehicle Implementation Predictions: Implications for Transport Planning

This report critically assesses the future of autonomous vehicles (AVs), challenging overly optimistic forecasts. It provides realistic predictions for their implementation and deployment, analyzing the profound implications for transport planning, particularly concerning travel demand, infrastructure, and social equity.

---

## Context & Motivation

The prospect of autonomous vehicles has generated immense interest, with many optimistic predictions suggesting rapid, widespread adoption and transformative benefits. However, this report argues that such forecasts often overlook significant complexities inherent in motor vehicle technology, which differs greatly from rapidly adopted consumer electronics like smartphones.

Motor vehicles are highly regulated, expensive, durable goods with the potential for fatal system failures, demanding extensive testing and robust infrastructure. Understanding the realistic timeline and multifaceted impacts of AVs is crucial for effective transport planning, as policy choices will heavily influence whether AVs contribute positively to community goals or exacerbate existing problems like congestion and sprawl.

---

## Methodology / Approach

This report adopts a critical, evidence-based approach to forecast AV implementation and analyze its implications. The methodology involves:

*   **Defining Operational Models:** Categorizing AVs by SAE J3016 levels and comparing four distinct operating models (Private Human-Driven, Private Autonomous, Shared Autonomous Vehicles, Shared Autonomous Rides) to understand their varied impacts.
*   **Comprehensive Benefit-Cost Analysis:** Meticulously detailing potential internal (user) and external (societal) benefits and costs, including financial, safety, environmental, and social equity impacts.
*   **Historical Technology Adoption Analysis:** Applying an S-curve model of innovation and drawing on historical precedents from past automotive technologies (e.g., automatic transmissions, airbags) to project realistic AV deployment timelines.
*   **Travel Demand Modeling:** Utilizing a "generalized cost" model to analyze how changes in travel costs (monetary and time) due to AVs could influence Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).
*   **Policy Alignment Assessment:** Evaluating how different AV deployment scenarios align with key community planning objectives and identifying necessary policy interventions, such as Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and efficient road pricing.

---

## Key Findings

The report's analysis yields several critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom about autonomous vehicles:

*   **Skepticism Towards Overly Optimistic Predictions:** Forecasts of widespread AV adoption by 2030 are unrealistic, driven by financial interests and inappropriate analogies to simpler technologies. Significant technical, regulatory, and cost hurdles remain.
*   **Slow and Phased Deployment Timeline:** Level 5 AVs, while potentially commercially available in the late 2020s, will only achieve 50% penetration of new vehicle sales by 2045 and 50% of the total fleet by 2060. Widespread affordability for all income levels is decades away.
*   **Mixed and Policy-Dependent Impacts on VMT:** Without policy intervention, AVs are likely to *increase* Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 10-30% due to factors like non-driver travel and empty vehicle trips. However, policies favoring shared AVs and multimodal communities could reduce VMT.
*   **Significant Social Equity Concerns:** Personal AVs will be unaffordable for many for decades, potentially exacerbating mobility disparities. Policies favoring private AVs are regressive, while shared AVs combined with Transportation Demand Management (TDM) are crucial for equitable access and broader societal benefits.
*   **New Risks and Overlooked Costs:** Beyond safety improvements, AVs introduce new risks such as hardware/software failures, hacking, increased risk-taking, and dangers to non-auto travelers. Shared AVs also incur substantial, often overlooked, costs for frequent cleaning, maintenance, and security.
*   **Policy is Paramount:** The ultimate impact of AVs—whether beneficial or detrimental—is not inherent to the technology but depends heavily on public policies that guide their design, deployment, and integration into the broader transportation system.

## Understanding the Economic Landscape of AVs

The economic implications of autonomous vehicles are complex, influencing both user adoption and broader societal costs.

![](data/documents/avip/images/image_4_page_3.png)
**Exhibit ES-1 / Exhibit 5 — Cost Comparison / Total Cost Comparison**
This bar chart illustrates the "Dollars Per Mile" for various transportation modes, highlighting that while shared AVs are cheaper than human-driven taxis, they are generally more expensive than private human-driven vehicles and public transit on an average cost basis. This visual is crucial for understanding why AV adoption, particularly for private ownership, may be slower than optimists suggest, as it challenges the notion that AVs will be universally cheaper.

**Exhibit ES-2 / Exhibit 9 — Autonomous Vehicle Potential Benefits and Costs**
This table provides a comprehensive overview of the potential benefits and costs of autonomous vehicles, distinguishing between internal impacts (affecting users) and external impacts (affecting society). It lists benefits like reduced driver stress and improved mobility, alongside costs such as increased vehicle prices, new user risks, and potential increases in traffic problems due to higher Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). This balanced perspective is fundamental to the report's skeptical stance on exaggerated benefits, highlighting the broad societal considerations beyond individual user advantages.

## The Complex Impact on Travel Demand (VMT)

The effect of autonomous vehicles on total Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is a critical and uncertain factor.

**Exhibit 10 — Potential Travel Impacts**
This table lists specific factors that could either increase or reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) due to autonomous vehicles. Factors like increased non-driver travel, empty vehicle trips, and reduced operating costs could increase VMT, while shared services and improved transit access could reduce it. This table is central to understanding the complex mechanisms through which AVs can influence travel behavior, providing a framework for assessing the potential for both increased congestion/sprawl and reductions in vehicle use.


| Increases Vehicle Travel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Reduces Vehicle Travel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| • Increased vehicle travel by non-drivers. • Empty vehicle travel to drop off and pick up passengers, deliver goods, and travelling to maintenance stations. • Reduced vehicle operating costs (due to electrification) increases vehicle travel. • Increased passenger convenience and productivity encourages people to travel more. • Over the long run encourages more sprawled development and reduced public transit service. | • More convenient shared vehicle services allow households to reduce vehicle ownership, which leverages vehicle travel reductions. • Self-driving buses, and better last-mile access, improve transit services. • Reduced traffic risk and parking facilities make urban living more attractive. |

**Exhibit 12 — Generalized Cost (Money and Time) Travel Demand Curve**
This line chart illustrates the relationship between "Generalized Cost Per Vehicle-Mile" and "Annual Vehicle Miles Per Traveler," showing that lower costs generally lead to higher travel. It positions various transportation modes along this curve, demonstrating how different AV cost structures (including the value of time) are likely to influence travel demand. This figure provides a powerful economic model supporting the idea that private AV ownership, especially for electric AVs, might incentivize more travel due to lower operating costs, impacting VMT.

## Realistic Deployment Timelines

Contrary to popular belief, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles will be a gradual, multi-decade process.

**Exhibit 18 — Vehicle Technology Deployment Summary**
This table summarizes the deployment cycles, cost premiums, and market saturation for several past vehicle technologies, such as automatic transmissions, airbags, and hybrid vehicles. It shows that most of these innovations took multiple decades (25 to over 100 years) to achieve high market penetration. This empirical evidence is crucial for the report's argument for a slow and phased AV deployment timeline, directly challenging optimistic predictions by demonstrating historical precedent.

## Policy Choices for Desired Outcomes

The societal impact of AVs is not predetermined; it hinges on deliberate policy decisions.

**Exhibit 22 — Comparing Benefits**
This table evaluates how different AV deployment models (Costly Personal AVs, Inexpensive Personal AVs, Shared AVs, Shared AVs with TDM Incentives) align with ten community planning objectives, such as congestion reduction, traffic safety, and social equity. It clearly shows that "Shared AVs with TDM Incentives" consistently achieve nearly all objectives, while "Costly Personal AVs" contradict most. This table is a critical policy tool, providing a direct comparison of how different AV strategies contribute to or detract from broader societal goals, powerfully reinforcing the importance of shared AVs with TDM.


| Community Objectives               | Likely Impacts                                                                                                                                                    |
|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Congestion reduction               | If they increase total vehicle travel they are likely to increase congestion.                                                                                     |
| Roadway cost savings               | If they increase total vehicle travel and requiring special roadway design features, they are likely to increase total roadway costs.                             |
| Parking cost savings               | If shared or programmed to drive to avoid parking they can reduce parking costs.                                                                                  |
| Consumer savings and affordability | Likely to be costly and so increase user costs unless shared.                                                                                                     |
| Traffic safety                     | Likely to reduce human errors but introduce new risks, and by increasing total vehicle travel may increase total crashes.                                         |
| Improved mobility options          | Can increase mobility options for non-drivers, particularly if they are affordable.                                                                               |
| Energy conservation                | If they increase vehicle weight or total vehicle travel they are likely to increase energy consumption and pollution emissions. These impacts are reduced but not |
| Pollution reduction                | eliminated if they are electric powered.                                                                                                                          |
| Physical fitness and health        | May reduce fitness and health if they encourage driving over other modes.                                                                                         |
| Strategic development objectives   | Likely to increase sprawl unless implemented with Smart Growth policies.                                                                                          |

**Exhibit 26 — Optimistic and Pessimistic Outcomes**
This table compares optimistic (best-case) and pessimistic (worst-case) outcomes for AV implementation across key policy and planning issues like vehicle sharing, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Optimistic outcomes align with community benefits (e.g., encouraging sharing, supporting transit), while pessimistic outcomes show AVs exacerbating problems (e.g., promoting luxury goods, leading to sprawl). This table is crucial for highlighting the high stakes of AV policy decisions, illustrating that AVs do not inherently lead to good outcomes; their societal impact is heavily dependent on proactive policy choices.

## Conclusions & Policy Implications

The core message of this report is that the future of autonomous vehicles is far more nuanced and protracted than often portrayed. AVs are not an automatic solution to transportation problems, and their transformative benefits are contingent on a realistic understanding of their development, costs, and societal impacts.

*   **Realistic Expectations:** Widespread adoption and affordability of Level 5 AVs will take decades, likely not before the 2040s-2060s. Planners must base decisions on this gradual timeline, not on overly optimistic forecasts.
*   **Policy-Driven Outcomes:** The ultimate impact of AVs on congestion, emissions, and social equity is not inherent but depends critically on public policies. Without proactive intervention, AVs could increase Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and exacerbate existing transportation challenges.
*   **Prioritize Shared Mobility and TDM:** To maximize societal benefits and ensure equitable access, policies must strongly encourage shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and integrate them with Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies. This approach is most effective in achieving community planning objectives.
*   **Address New Risks and Costs:** Policymakers must account for new risks (e.g., software failures, hacking) and overlooked costs (e.g., maintenance for shared fleets) in their planning and regulatory frameworks. Ethical dilemmas, such as the "trolley problem," require careful public policy guidance.
*   **Long-Term Strategic Planning:** Transportation professionals have a crucial role in guiding the transition to AVs, ensuring that their deployment aligns with strategic community goals for sustainability, equity, and efficiency. This requires a long-term, adaptive planning approach that considers the interplay of AVs with other trends and technologies.
